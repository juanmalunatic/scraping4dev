Financial hardship often creates stress, which may lead to mental illness over time. In turn, mental health challenges can reduce labor force participation and productivity, deepening poverty. This suggests that while individual poverty or mental health interventions may yield cross-sector benefits, integrated programs addressing both issues simultaneously might be particularly effective in breaking the cycle. Additionally, if mental health and poverty are strongly connected, interventions that address both simultaneously might be particularly effective. Can interventions targeting either poverty or mental health, or both together, improve both economic and psychological well-being?", "context_of_eval": "The evaluation was conducted in Nakuru County in Central Kenya, an area selected due to the implementing NGO already having established a presence there, as well as high levels of people living in poverty and with poor mental health. Before the study, 33 percent of the study participants were classified as experiencing psychological distress, according to the NGO’s criteria. The psychotherapy program evaluated in this study, Problem Management Plus (PM+), was run by a large international NGO that hired and trained clinical supervisors and community health assistants, who in turn trained community health workers (CHWs). The program was developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) specifically for low-resource settings. PM+ had previously shown effectiveness in improving mental health in Kenya in a study with women who had experienced gender-based violence1. The cash transfers were delivered by Busara Center for Behavioral Economics through M-Pesa (mobile money transfer system operated by Safaricom that allows people to deposit and withdraw money at various locations throughout Kenya). The majority of respondents had personal M-Pesa accounts, and those who did not were offered phones to set up accounts.", "details_inter": "Researchers partnered with a large international NGO and the Busara Center for Behavioral Economics to evaluate the impact of unconditional cash transfers, a psychotherapy program, and their combination on measures of economic and psychological well-being. First, they randomly assigned 233 villages in rural Kenya to one of four following groups and then randomly assigned 5,756 low-income households across these villages: Cash transfer Group (CT) (540 households in 60 villages): Households were offered an unconditional cash transfer of US$1,076 purchasing power parity2 (PPP) (US$485 nominal), corresponding to about 20 months of per capita consumption. Cash transfers were randomly delivered as a lump-sum payment or in five weekly installments. Problem Management Plus Group (PM+) (525 households in 60 villages): Households were offered the PM+ psychotherapy intervention, which consisted of five 90-minute one-on-one sessions over five weeks delivered by community health workers (CHWs). The program taught five strategies: problem-solving, managing stress, managing problems, behavioral activation (\"get going, keep doing\"), and strengthening social support. Combined Group (CT&PM+) (493 households in 53 villages): Households were offered both the cash transfer and the PM+ intervention. Comparison Group (1,703 households in 60 villages): Households were not offered any program. The programs were delivered between May 2017 and January 2018 with two breaks in August and October-November 2017 due to elections. To study the effect of the program, researchers implemented a survey both before the program started (between October 2016 and March 2017) and about a year after the program ended (between August 2018 and May 2019). The surveys included questions on consumption, food security, assets, revenue, profits, labor, education, psychological well-being, and intimate partner violence. To assess indirect and unintended effects at the village-level (spillovers), researchers also surveyed non-recipient households in areas receiving the CT-only (1,237 households) and PM+-only (1,219 households) interventions. In villages assigned to CT and CT&PM+, half of the cash transfer recipients were randomly given a lump-sum payment, while the other half received five weekly installments, allowing researchers to study how transfer frequency influences outcomes.", "results_lessons": "One year after the interventions, cash transfers improved both economic and psychological outcomes, while the psychotherapy program had no measurable positive effects on either outcome. The effects of the combined intervention were similar to those of cash transfers alone. Economic outcomes: The cash transfers improved economic as well as psychological wellbeing. Households who were assigned to receive a cash transfer had a 20 percent increase in monthly consumption (an increase by US$10.51 PPP compared to a comparison group mean of US$52.49 PPP), a 47 percent increase in asset holdings (an increase of US$262.06 PPP compared to a comparison group mean of US$553.16 PPP), and a 26 percent increase in household revenue (an increase by US$35.18 PPP per month compared to the comparison average of US$135.48 PPP) one year after the program ended. The PM+ intervention did not significantly affect economic outcomes and there was no significant difference between the PM+ Group and the comparison group. The results between the CT group households and the CT&PM+ group were very similar, with asset holdings increasing by 41 percent, and household revenue by 17 percent. However, the combined program had a measurable, but not significant impact on consumption. Psychological well-being: Cash transfers improved an index of psychological well-being by 0.23 standard deviations. This improvement was driven by a 0.21 standard deviation increase in life satisfaction, a 0.19 standard deviation increase in happiness, and 0.16 standard deviation decreases in both perceived stress and psychological distress measured by the General Health Questionnaire-12 (a 12-item screener for general psychiatric conditions)3. Households who received both programs improved psychological well-being by 0.27 standard deviations, similar to the effect of cash transfers alone. However, the combined program had a larger impact on life satisfaction (0.39 standard deviations) compared to cash transfers alone (0.21 standard deviations). In contrast, households who received only the PM+ program experienced no effect on psychological well-being. PM+ also had no effects on psychological well-being among participants who had high psychological distress before the evaluation. Since the PM+ program had previously been implemented successfully by the same NGO in Kenya, researchers assume that it may be most effective when used to address a specific problem (previously, survivors of gender-based violence were targeted), rather than general psychological distress. Transfer frequency: Weekly cash transfers were more effective than lump-sum transfers in improving economic outcomes. Weekly transfers increased consumption by US$14.98 PPP (28 percent) and monthly household revenue by US$51.71 PPP (39 percent), while the effect on all other outcomes were not statistically significant. Taken together, the research showed that the PM+ treatment alone did not improve outcomes, but that cash transfers were effective in improving both economic and psychological well-being in this context.", "citations": "Haushofer, Johannes, Robert Mudida, and Jeremy Shapiro. \" The Comparative Impact of Cash Transfers and a Psychotherapy Program on Psychological and Economic Well-being.\" Working Paper February 2023. https://haushofer.ne.su.se/publications/Haushofer_Mudida_Shapiro_Cash_Therapy_2023.pdf.", "run_id": "2026-02-24 182618", "scraped_at": "2026-02-24T18:30:52", "hash": "9defbc3a0e8fcebc9540dc744918a96ef75b692c8d6c420434d2e39ad1ae5988"}

To address this, researchers conducted a randomized evaluation to test the impact of an in-school remedial education program on student learning in Odisha, India. Both the standard and a version that allowed teacher flexibility improved student test scores without reducing grade- level mastery or affecting the likelihood of passing exams.", "policy_issue": "Public-sector organizations often face a fundamental trade-off: whether to allow workers discretion to adapt services to local needs or enforce rigid, standardized rules to ensure uniform delivery. Education systems face a similar tension. Low learning levels among secondary school students are a persistent challenge in many low- and middle-income countries. Public schools often follow a standardized curriculum that assumes students are performing at grade level, even when many are years behind. Despite this gap, teachers are expected to deliver grade-level content on a fixed schedule, often enforced by high-stakes exams. While teaching students at their level has shown promise in primary education, there is limited evidence on its effectiveness in secondary schools, where learning gaps are wider and classrooms more mixed in ability. Policymakers also worry that giving teachers flexibility could lead to poor teaching or reduced effort. This evaluation addresses a key question: Can remedial education help secondary students catch up without harming those already at grade level, and could giving teachers more flexibility help to amplify these gains?", "context_of_eval": "In India, many students enter secondary school far behind grade level. Grades 9 and 10 are a critical bridge to higher education but are associated with high dropout rates, especially among girls. Students often lack the foundational skills needed to understand advanced material or succeed on the high-stakes Class 10 board exams. In the Indian state of Odisha, about one-third of the population lives below the national poverty line. Nearly half of its secondary students fail to meet basic international benchmarks in math, though the top 5 percent outperform peers in other low-income countries, highlighting stark learning disparities. This study focused on 300 government secondary schools in two largely rural districts, Jajpur and Dhenkanal. Among those in the study, about 40 percent belonged to Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes (disadvantaged groups in India), and 15 percent had parents who could not read or write. At the start of the program, the average Class 9 student was 4–5 grade levels behind in English, math, and the local language Odia, and nearly half tested below Class 3 competency. The Utkarsh (“Excellence”) program, developed by Transform Schools, People for Action, and the Kusuma Trust UK, and implemented with the Odisha Department of School and Mass Education, aims to help Class 9 students strengthen foundational skills and prepare for board exams by leveraging existing teachers and class time. It combines remedial and grade-level instruction across three phases: 18 days of basic skill building (Foundation Camp), 45 days to reinforce and apply these skills (Supported Learning Phase), and 6 days of grade-level preparation (Consolidation Camp).", "details_inter": "Researchers partnered with Transform Schools, People for Action (PFA), and the Odisha Department of School and Mass Education to conduct a randomized evaluation to measure the impact of two variations of Utkarsh. Researchers randomly assigned 300 government secondary schools in the Jaipur and Dhenkanal districts to one of three groups: Standard group (100 schools). These schools received the full version of Utkarsh. Teachers were trained in a one-week session and provided with teaching and learning materials, including daily topic outlines and student worksheets, organized into class- specific phases covering concepts from Classes 3–8. They were instructed to implement topics and lesson plans according to a pre-specified schedule. Lessons were not fully scripted, and all instruction occurred during the regular school day using existing teachers and infrastructure. Flexible group (100 schools). These schools received the same Utkarsh training and materials as the standard group, but teachers were given the guidance that they had the flexibility to adapt topics and/or timelines according to the needs of their students. Comparison group (100 schools). These schools did not receive the Utkarsh program and continued with the regular curriculum and teaching. Before the program began, researchers administered tests in Odia, math, and English to understand students’ initial skills. To understand how the program was being implemented in practice, they made unannounced classroom visits during the intervention, when schools were expected to be carrying out FC or SLP. About four months after the program began, researchers administered surveys and standardized tests in Odia, math, English, and science to measure learning outcomes. Because regular Class 10 exams were canceled due to COVID-19, they later collected administrative data on Board Marks, based on a weighted average of their teacher- assigned Class 9 (40 percent) and Class 10 (60 percent) scores, and conducted a follow-up phone survey to track students’ schooling and employment outcomes.", "results_lessons": "Both the structured and flexible versions of the Utkarsh remedial education program improved student learning in similar amounts relative to the comparison group, without crowding out grade- level skills, and were cost-effective. Short-term learning gains. Students in both Utkarsh groups scored an average of 0.11 standard deviations higher in Odia, English, mathematics, and science at the end of the school year relative to the comparison group’s learning progress of 0.19 standard deviations in the same period. In practical terms, this roughly translates to 60 percent of a typical year of learning, meaning students learned in one term what the comparison group would normally achieve in a little over one and a half terms. The likelihood of achieving Class 3 or Class 5 competency rose by 3–8 percentage points, depending upon subject, relative to the comparison group. However, there were no difference in full Class 9 mastery between the program and comparison groups. Researchers noted this was unsurprising because the program’s four-month timeframe was too short for students who were 4–5 grades behind to catch up fully, and importantly, students already at or near grade level did not fall behind, indicating the program did not harm higher-performing students. Longer-term outcomes. Students in the intervention groups did not pass the exams at higher rates, as pass rates were already extremely high—over 99 percent in both program and comparison schools. However, students in the Standard Utkarsh arm received slightly lower average Board Marks, a pattern researchers interpret as consistent with teachers’ more realistic grading after better understanding students’ true learning levels through the program’s leveling exams and exposure to remedial content. The effect on Board Marks for the Flexible group was about half as large, and the evidence did not clearly rule out chance as an explanation. Two years after the program, researchers found no measurable differences in school enrollment or employment outcomes between students in the program and comparison groups. Teacher engagement and program delivery. Researchers found no evidence that flexibility reduced teacher effort or resulted in neglect of duties. Even without explicit flexibility, many teachers adjusted lesson pacing and content to match student needs: nearly 77 percent of comparison group teachers and 78 percent of Standard Utkarsh teachers reported they could adjust content if students struggled, and this rose to about 84 percent in the Flexible arm. Only 82 percent of Standard Utkarsh teachers and 73 percent of Flexible Utkarsh teachers stayed within one week of the official timetable. While teachers in the flexible group made slightly more deviations from the prescribed schedule, they largely continued delivering remedial material. Teachers in intervention schools also developed more accurate perceptions of their students’ abilities by the end of the program, reducing their estimates of student’s literacy and numeracy by 5–11 percentage points. In structured education systems, improving service delivery may require adjusting rules and giving teachers more freedom to respond to local needs. While there are often concerns about disrupting established routines, researchers found that teachers were able to successfully adapt to a new, more effective classroom approach that benefited both them and their students. Use of Results: The Utkarsh program has been scaled up both across the original state (Odisha, population 40 million) and also in new states (Karnataka, population 60 million; Chhattisgarh, 30 million; Haryana, 25 million; and Uttar Pradesh, 236 million). It has already reached more than 9.1 million students, and there are plans to expand the program further. Cost-analysis: At a 200-school scale, the program cost approximately US$11.64 per student, with both versions equally cost-effective. This translates to a gain of 0.95 SD in overall test scores per $100 spent. This places Utkarsh among the most cost-effective secondary school interventions documented in South Asia, comparable to Mindspark, which increased learning outcomes by 0.93 SD per $100 at a 50-school scale and the eLearn program which increased test scores by 1.4 SD per $100 at a 200-school scale.", "citations": "Beg, Sarbin A., Anne E.

Individuals who engaged in group discussions and individuals who were shown a video that affirmed the legal rights of transgender individuals were more likely to hire transgender individuals. Group discussions were most effective.", "policy_issue": "Discrimination carries high economic costs. Biased managers can make workers from minority groups less productive, while prejudice contributes to significant wage gaps that harm both individuals and the broader economy.1 Though individual prejudice is often seen as deep-seated and difficult to change, social norms can shift rapidly; in recent decades, many societies have seen dramatic increases in acceptance for gender equality, gay rights, and interethnic marriage.2 This suggests that interventions targeting social dynamics, not just individual beliefs, may be effective. A well-studied approach is to foster contact between majority and minority groups, which has been shown to reduce prejudice.3 For instance, mixing Christian and Muslim youth in Nigerian classrooms successfully reduced discrimination.4 However, the reach of such interventions is limited by a simple reality: people mostly interact with others from their own identity group.5 This makes scalable intergroup contact difficult. It also raises an underexplored question for policymakers: can communication within the majority group itself be harnessed to reduce discrimination against an outside minority?", "context_of_eval": "This study focuses on the thirunangai, a community of transgender women in the state of Tamil Nadu, India, with a long-standing cultural and religious role in society. Their visually recognizable identity, however, leaves them particularly susceptible to economic discrimination and violence. Transgender people are often excluded from traditional forms of paid employment, pushing many into poverty and sex work. There are at least 0.5-1.25 million transgender people in India, implying that such discrimination results in large welfare and efficiency costs. The study took place in urban Chennai with 3,397 non-transgender participants. This context is marked by a stark disconnect between norms and behavior. While discriminatory actions are common, there is widespread agreement that discrimination is wrong; 93 percent of comparison group participants described an act of discrimination as wrong. Recent legal changes, such as a 2014 Supreme Court ruling affirming the constitutional rights of transgender people, have had relatively limited impact on behavior, partly due to low awareness (36 percent of the participants were unaware of these rights). This gap between what people do (descriptive norms) and what they say is right (prescriptive norms) provided a unique opportunity to test whether communication could activate latent anti-discrimination sentiment.", "details_inter": "The researcher conducted a randomized evaluation to measure the impact of group discussions between non-transgender individuals and video screenings about legal rights on hiring discrimination against transgender individuals. The researcher randomly assigned 3,397 non-transgender individuals into variations of group discussions described below. The experiment was framed as market research for a grocery delivery service to measure real hiring decisions while minimizing the risk that participants would guess the study's true purpose. The primary outcome was measured through a series of 10 private, binary hiring choices. In each choice, participants were shown photos of two potential delivery workers—one always a cisgender man and the other a cisgender man, a cisgender woman, or a transgender woman—and had to choose one. Their choice involved real trade-offs between the worker they preferred and the groceries they would receive. Participants were assigned to the following groups: 3-person discussion (890 participants): All three participants in the group engaged in a 10-minute discussion about their preferred hiring choices and then made collective decisions about which workers to select. 2-person discussion (549 participants): Two participants were randomly selected to discuss and make choices for the group while the third participant listened to the discussion. Public but no discussion (599 participants): All three participants made their individual choices with the knowledge that the choices would be later revealed to the group. This group did not engage in a discussion prior to decision making. Comparison group (1,365 participants): Participants made all ten choices individually and privately. To compare the impact of the different group discussions with information sharing through video screenings, the researchers also randomly assigned the same 3,397 individuals into three additional groups: Legal rights video (1,135 participants): Participants watched a 2-minute video showing information on the Supreme Court of India’s ruling giving transgender people the same fundamental rights as others. Rights messaging video (1,135 participants): Participants watched a video in which they were told that transgender people should have the same fundamental rights as others without mentioning that they have these rights. Comparison group (1,135 participants): Participants watched a video that discussed voting rights but did not mention transgender rights. To measure the impact of the group discussions and the videos, researchers examined private participants’ hiring choices after the intervention to see if they selected transgender workers more often. On average 35 days after the initial survey, participants were given another survey to measure the persistence of their choices.", "results_lessons": "Both participating in group discussions and being informed about the legal rights of transgender individuals through videos reduced hiring discrimination against transgender women among residents of Chennai. One month after the intervention only individuals in the group discussions continued to discriminate less. Hiring choices: Compared to individuals in the comparison group that did not take part in group discussions, participants in 3-person discussions (group one) were 17 percentage points more likely to select a transgender individual for their delivery (a 42 percent increase). Participants in the 2-person discussion arm (group two) were 13 percentage points more likely while participants in the public but no-discussion arm (group three), were not more likely than the comparison group to hire transgender individuals. Participants who were offered the legal rights video and the rights messaging video were 10.3 percentage points (a 23 percent increase) and 5.8 percentage points (a 13 percent increase) more to hire a transgender individual, respectively. Benchmarking discrimination: Group discussion reduced participants’ willingness to sacrifice grocery items to avoid hiring a transgender worker. Participants in the comparison group were willing to forgo items worth nearly twice the median daily per capita food expenditure whereas those in the 3-person discussion arm (group one) were not willing to sacrifice any items, on average. Persistence of reduced discrimination: Participants in the 3-person discussion arm (group one) continued to discriminate less for 2-9 weeks after the discussions took place. These participants were four percentage points (an eleven percent increase) more likely to hire transgender individuals in a hypothetical follow-up decision compared to participants in the comparison group. In other words, 25 percent of the short-term impact persisted after approximately one month. On the other hand, participants who viewed transgender rights videos did not discriminate less one month after the intervention. Participants’ behavior likely shifted because the group discussions changed the perceived social norms around hiring. Pro-transgender participants spoke up more often, making supportive statements 2.5 times more common than anti-transgender ones. Their arguments were morally persuasive, emphasizing values like opportunity, rights, and equality. This imbalance appears to have led participants to revise their views of how much others discriminate—raising their estimates of neighbors’ willingness to hire transgender workers by 24 percentage points. Policy Lessons: Promote peer-to-peer dialogue: In the right circumstances, communication within existing social networks can be an inexpensive way to reduce discrimination. However, this might not always work.. In cases where people claim to already be against discrimination, governments and NGOs could consider designing and testing programs that facilitate structured but undirected conversations in community centers, schools, and workplaces. Target contexts where prescriptive norms are favorable: This approach is most likely to succeed in settings where a gap already exists between widespread discriminatory behavior and a widely held belief that discrimination is wrong. Attitude surveys can help identify these promising contexts. Empower internal advocates: The study shows a vocal minority can drive change. Rather than relying on outside experts, policies can be designed to identify and empower members within a community or organization who already promote fairness training them to become effective advocates for shifting group norms.", "citations": "\"Silence to Solidarity: Using Group Dynamics to Reduce Anti-Transgender Discrimination in India.\" Working Paper 2024.", "run_id": "2026-02-24 182618", "scraped_at": "2026-02-24T18:30:52", "hash": "ff45dc6f4e27cf67573775ab143b83e36157e240696e03bf88070da032b76225"}

Globally, women earn 20 percent less than men on average, and are less likely to participate in the labor force or hold decision-making roles. Family members, religious leaders, and community expectations often uphold restrictive gender norms that limit women’s autonomy in education, employment, and household decisions. These restrictions, in turn, contribute to lower female labor force participation. Programs that aim to shift gender norms often address gender directly, but this can trigger backlash in conservative settings. While job training programs are typically designed to improve employment outcomes, their effects on gender norms are less understood. Emerging evidence suggests that such programs can influence outcomes beyond the labor market, like reducing crime recidivism by helping participants build skills, access employment, and strengthen social ties that promote stability and reduce risky behaviors. Can job training also shift gender attitudes in a similar way, by exposing participants to new people and beliefs at their workplaces?", "context_of_eval": "In Kaduna and Katsina, two states in Northern Nigeria, many women are held back from making their own choices about education, employment, and mobility because of strict gender norms and a conservative interpretation of Islam. Both states have been under Sharia law since the early 2000s. Women often face restrictions under the practice of kulle (seclusion), which in its strictest form prohibits married women from interacting with non-family members of the opposite sex. These norms are reflected in attitudes among youth: 77 percent of the study sample said that husbands should decide whether wives are allowed to work outside the home. Girls also face pressure to marry and have children early. At age 20, 41 percent of women in the study were married, compared to just 1 percent of men. 55 percent of caregivers believed that husbands alone should decide whether the couple has children. Fathers of unmarried girls often have the final say over decisions about education, training, and employment. These gender norms contribute to low levels of female labor force participation and social empowerment, which in turn are linked to high poverty rates. In Kaduna and Katsina, 74 and 66 percent of people live under US$1 per day, respectively. Unemployment rates in both states exceed 25 percent.", "details_inter": "From 2015 to 2020, Adam Smith International ran the Mafita program in Northern Nigeria to help marginalized youth access skilled work or self-employment. Mafita included outreach, mentoring, support services, as well as a vocational training program known as the Community Skills Development Centers (COSDEC) program. In partnership with the Nigerian National Board for Technical Education, Mafita designed a locally relevant COSDEC curriculum. COSDEC targeted low-income youth aged 15 to 24, including early school leavers, orphans and vulnerable children, persons with disabilities, and those with limited access to formal education. Training began with three months of foundational (literacy, numeracy, and basic science) and soft skills (goal-setting, interpersonal communication, etc.) followed by nine months of trade training in one of seven areas: Carpentry and Joinery, Electrical Installation, Fashion Design, Hospitality, Masonry, Office Management, and Welding and Fabrication. Researchers conducted a randomized evaluation in Northern Nigeria to test the impact of providing a gender-neutral job training to marginalized youth on their gender norms by expanding their economic opportunities. The training took place in six different centers in Kaduna and Katsina, with a total of 1,824 participants. Participants applied to a specific trade training at their local center. Researchers then randomly selected 900 applicants from the different center-trade applicant pools to be offered the training, known as the intervention group. Some intervention group participants also engaged in an additional two-month training in entrepreneurship and business administration. The remaining 924 participants were assigned to the comparison group, did not receive any training, and were not allowed to apply to a different trade or center for the duration of the study. The evaluation ran from April 2017 to March 2018, with 73 percent of participants in the intervention group completing the program; researchers measured outcomes nine to fourteen months later. Researchers measured youth gender norms through an index that combined survey responses around household decision-making, women’s equality and role in society, and domestic violence. They measured caregiver gender norms through a similar index that included female labor force participation and excluded domestic violence. Researchers also measured economic outcomes through the income and employment index which combined indicators on wage employment status, days worked, and monthly earnings.", "results_lessons": "Youth who were offered job training adopted more progressive gender views, even though the training did not discuss gender. Their caregivers also became more supportive of women’s roles in work and decision-making. Evidence suggests that job training helped youth from conservative communities enter the labor market and build new social connections, which fostered more progressive gender views. Labor Market Success: Youth who were offered training were 4.2 percentage points more likely to be employed compared to 10.9 percent employment among their peers (a 39 percent increase). They were also 13.7 percentage points more likely to be self-employed, from a base of 38 percent. Youth in the training group also earned ₦403 (USD 1.3) more per month than the comparison group (a 54 percent increase from a baseline of ₦752 (USD 2.5). Evidence indicates that labor market success explains about 20 percent of the shift in gender norms after the training. Researchers suggest that when youth secured jobs following the training, they observed women succeeding in the workplace and encountered new beliefs through interactions with coworkers, customers and bosses. Social interaction: Youth who were offered training broadened their social interactions without losing existing connections or altering religious beliefs. They had 0.013 more friends of the opposite gender (a 29 percent increase from 0.045 in the comparison group). They also had, on average, 0.12 more friends from outside their neighborhood (a 10 percent increase from 1.2) and 0.27 more friends who were employed (a 10 percent increase from 2.8). Although trained youth did not report more friends from other religions or any new opinions on religious enforcement, they reported greater trust in leaders and people of other religions. These shifts in social interaction appear to be a key mechanism through which economic gains led to changes in gender attitudes: broader social networks were associated with more progressive views on women’s roles in society and household decision-making. Youths’ Gender norms: As a result of the training, youth adopted more equitable views on household decision-making norms and women’s role in society. For example, youth who were offered training were 8.8 percentage points more likely to believe boys should do as much domestic work as girls (a 31 percent increase from 28 percent). Similarly, trained youth were 6.2 percentage points more likely to believe girls should speak as much as boys in class, a 14 percent increase from 45 percent in the comparison group. Caregivers’ gender attitudes: Caregivers of participants also showed improved gender attitudes. For example, the belief that women should occupy leadership positions in society increased by 6.5 percentage points from a baseline of 85 percent, an 8 percent increase. Similarly, the belief that girls should speak as much as boys in class rose by 6.9 percentage points from a baseline of 75 percent, a 9 percent increase. These effects were particularly strong for caregivers with a female dependent enrolled in the study. Vocational training can be a powerful tool not only for improving economic livelihoods but also for shifting gender beliefs in conservative societies, even when the curriculum does not directly address gender inequity.", "citations": "Crost, Benjamin, Oeindrila Dube, Marcus Holmlund, Eric Mvukiyehe, and Emily Crawford. \"Can Economics Opportunities Reshape Gender Norms among Religious Youth?

Growing evidence shows low teacher effort can contribute to this. Contract teacher programs, where teachers are hired on short-term contracts at lower wages, have shown promise in improving learning outcomes at low cost, particularly when implemented by NGOs. These programs add more teachers to schools at a lower cost, thus reducing class sizes. Contracts can be renewed for strong performers, which helps schools keep better teachers, and the lack of permanent tenure gives teachers stronger incentives to work hard. Importantly, NGOs have partnered with government schools to implement these programs, showing that the model can work in public education systems. However, it remains unclear whether such programs can be effectively scaled by governments, which often face political resistance and limited bureaucratic capacity. This evaluation addresses a critical question: Can governments replicate the success of NGO-led education interventions at scale?", "context_of_eval": "In Kenya, 81 percent of children are enrolled in primary school as of 2006. However, learning outcomes remain low. Only three out of ten third-grade students could read a basic English story or solve second-grade division problems. This issue is often attributed to the severe shortage of qualified teachers: in 2011, the government reported a gap of 61,000 civil service teachers in the country due largely to a hiring freeze. At the same time, civil service salaries were relatively high, creating a long queue of qualified graduates waiting for government teaching jobs. To address this, the government piloted a contract teacher initiative, providing funds to schools to hire teachers on short-term, lower-wage contracts outside the civil service system. Previous evidence showed that such NGO-led contract teacher programs in public schools improved student learning outcomes in Kenya. This evaluation tested whether the same model could be scaled effectively by the government, which faced different political and bureaucratic constraints.", "details_inter": "Researchers collaborated with Kenya’s Ministry of Education and the NGO World Vision Kenya to conduct a randomized evaluation to test whether Kenya’s NGO-led contract teacher program could be scaled up effectively by the government. The evaluation took place between June 2010 to October 2011 in 192 public-primary schools (roughly 15,000 students) across fourteen districts and all eight Kenyan provinces. These schools had high student-teacher ratios. They were also larger and had lower test scores than the national average. Contract teachers, who were required to hold a teaching certificate, were placed in either second or third grade in the first year, and all were moved to third grade in the second year. Schools were instructed to split classes to reduce pupil-teacher ratios. Students receiving a contract teacher were typically between seven and eleven years old. The intervention involved multiple levels of randomization. Each school in the program received a contract teacher hired either by the government (64 schools) or the NGO (64 schools) or else was assigned to a comparison group and received no contract teacher (64 schools). The schools with contract teachers hired by the government or the NGO were further randomized to better understand the impacts of: High versus low teacher salaries: Teachers in 96 schools were offered KES 5,000 ($67) per month. Those in the remaining 32 were offered KES 9,000 ($121), which was equivalent to 50 percent of the average entry level civil servant teacher salary. Local versus central responsibility for recruiting and paying teachers: Contract teachers in 64 schools across government and NGO implementation were recruited and paid by local school management committees (SMCs), while teachers in the remaining 64 schools were recruited and paid either by the central education authorities, similarly to civil service teachers (for government-implemented schools) or by the NGO headquarter office in Nairobi. Local accountability: 64 schools received a training intervention focused on ensuring SMCs understood the role of contract teachers in their schools, while the remaining 64 schools received no such sensitization. The table below depicts how many schools received each type of intervention.", "results_lessons": "On average, hiring contract teachers improved student learning outcomes in English and math across all NGO-implemented schools, but it had no impact on test scores when implemented by the government, suggesting the design of the program, political considerations, and bureaucratic constraints were important considerations behind the program’s impact. The most effective intervention combinations varied between NGO- and government-implemented schools. In the NGO arm, the most effective design involved high salaries and training for SMCs. This combination led to test score gains of 0.81 standard deviations. By contrast in the government arm, the best-performing group involved high salary, SMC training, and centralized hiring, yielding gains of 0.53 standard deviations. NGOs were able to rely on local oversight and community involvement to manage the program effectively. In contrast, the government needed more centralized control to ensure consistency and follow-through, given its larger and more complex administrative structure. Political pushback may have affected the government’s ability to implement the most effective design. The government’s national scale-up of the contract teacher program triggered opposition from the teachers’ union, which demanded permanent civil service status for all contract teachers. This undermined the credibility of short-term contracts and weakened teacher incentives. Teachers in the government arm were more likely to identify with the union and less likely to believe their contracts were performance-based, which also disrupted the link between effort and pay, contributing to the absence of learning gains in the government-implemented version. Bureaucratic constraints may also have driven differences in impact between government- and NGO-implemented programs. On average, contract teachers hired by NGO-managed schools were more likely to be present in class (72.7 percent attendance in the NGO arm compared to 62.8 percent in the government arm), received fewer salary delays (2 months in the NGO arm compared to 3 months in the government arm), and were better monitored (96.1 percent of schools in the NGO arm had a monitoring visit compared to 85 percent in the government arm). These factors likely contributed to improved student performance. In contrast, government-managed schools faced implementation challenges, including delayed payments and weaker oversight. These issues weakened the accountability mechanisms that were central to the program’s theory of change, making it harder to link contract status to teacher effort and ultimately reducing the impact on learning.", "citations": "Bold, Tessa, Mwangi Kimenyi, Germano Mwabu, Alice Ng'ang'a, and Justin Sandefur. 2018. \"Experimental Evidence on Scaling up Education Reforms in Kenya.\" Journal of Public Economics 168 (2018): 1-20.", "run_id": "2026-02-24 182618", "scraped_at": "2026-02-24T18:30:52", "hash": "3b0898e6188b48659d0b85639a266fa2117cde1d29a2d33f20fdc0aaba1209a5"}

High-quality teaching is especially important in tutoring, which is one of the most effective ways to improve student outcomes and close educational gaps. Tutoring plays a particularly important role in math, a subject that is difficult to teach yet strongly tied to college completion and future income. Human-computer collaborations could be a powerful way to make use of the strengths of both humans and technology to improve education. Generative AI, particularly language models, could support new educators with their teaching. However, standard language models have limitations, since they often lack context, give direct answers instead of encouraging critical thinking, and overall have not yet shown clear improvements in learning outcomes.

The researchers introduced Tutor CoPilot, an AI program designed to improve education outcomes by providing tutors with real-time expert-like guidance during live sessions. Tutor CoPilot was integrated into a virtual tutoring platform with features like a problem display, shared whiteboard, and chat window. When the tutor activated it, Tutor CoPilot analyzed the ongoing content and interaction in the chat and offered tailored suggestions for responses to the tutors. Tutors were able to customize the guidance by editing or regenerating suggestions, or choosing from different strategies such as providing the solution, offering an example, providing a minor correction, giving a similar problem, simplifying the question, or encouraging the student. The evaluation took place over two months from March to May 2024. The researchers randomly assigned 783 full-time tutors into two groups: 1. Tutor CoPilot group (388 tutors): Tutors were given access to Tutor CoPilot. 2. Comparison group (395 tutors): Tutors were not given access to Tutor CoPilot. On average the tutors had about 21.5 months tutoring experience. To rate the quality of tutors, the provider observed a random selection of the tutor’s sessions and averaged the scores from an observation form. The tutors in the Tutor Co-Pilot Group received training on how to use Tutor CoPilot prior to their first tutoring sessions. Session outcomes were evaluated based on student’s mastery of the lesson content required for progressing to the next lesson and measured in “exit tickets.” The researchers also collected session chat, whiteboard activity, and overall Tutor Co-Pilot usage. In addition, qualitative interviews were conducted with tutors after the sessions. The following steps were taken to protect the users’ privacy and information in the implementation of the Tutor CoPilot system: The names of the students and tutors were de-identified before any data was shared through external application interfaces, and the conversation used as context was limited to the most recent 10 messages in order to limit the amount of user information shared.", "results_lessons": "Researchers found that Tutor CoPilot improved student learning outcomes as measured by student mastery of a lesson topic, measured in “exit tickets,” was especially beneficial to students of lower-rated and less-experienced tutors, and enhanced the quality of tutor engagement. Student learning: Students whose tutor had access to Tutor CoPilot had improved learning gains right after the tutoring session. They were four percentage points more likely to pass their exit tickets (66 percent of students in the Tutor CoPilot group compared to 62 percent in the comparison group). The study was not set up to assess Tutor CoPilot’s direct effects on statewide end-of-year math test scores. Impact on tutor effectiveness: Students of lower rated tutors were nine percentage points more likely to pass their exit tickets (65 percent in the Tutor CoPilot group compared to 56 percent in the comparison group). Students of less-experienced tutors were seven percentage points more likely to pass their exit tickets (68 percent in the Tutor CoPilot group compared to 61 percent in the comparison group). The tool helped less-effective tutors achieve outcomes similar to their higher-performing peers in the comparison group. Tutoring quality: Tutors with access to Tutor CoPilot were more likely than tutors without access to Tutor CoPilot to apply strategies that promoted student understanding, engagement, and skill development, e.g., asking students to further explain or asking questions to guide student thinking. In contrast, tutors without the tool tended to provide more direct or passive support, e.g., giving solution strategies or generic encouragement, compared to tutors with access to the tool. Perception of Tutor CoPilot by tutors: In post-lesson interviews, tutors generally found Tutor CoPilot helpful, especially for its clear explanations and ability to break down complex concepts in real time. However, some also noted areas for improvement, such as aligning suggestions more closely with students’ grade levels. Some responses were described as too advanced, requiring tutors to adapt and simplify the guidance. Cost-analysis: The total application programming interface cost for integrating the Tutor CoPilot program for 388 tutors over the 2-month study was US$1,419.66, resulting in an estimated annual cost of about US$20 per tutor. This does not include other costs for the tutoring program like salaries. Use of Results: The tutoring provider FEV Tutor incorporated Tutor CoPilot into all of its tutoring sessions following this study. Although FEV Tutor is no longer active as a company as of January 2025, other companies that offer tutoring services, such as Eedi, have adapted the concept of Tutor CoPilot and implemented it to support human tutors in chat-based tutoring systems. Taken together, the research on Tutor CoPilot demonstrated that AI-generated guidance, based on expert thinking, can improve tutor quality at a low cost with the potential to scale. As policymakers and researchers continue to explore the future of human-AI collaboration in real-world contexts like education, areas for further research include how well tutors retain the skills gained through real-time AI guidance; expanding Tutor CoPilot to new subjects, age groups, and skill areas; or examining how tutors personalize AI suggestions.", "citations": "Wang, Rose E., Ana T.

PayDash access reduced wage payment delays and increased household participation in MGNREGS. Its impact primarily came from making real-time payment processing information more accessible to bureaucrats.", "policy_issue": "Roughly one in four people worldwide receive government payments1. Yet, these payments are often delayed in the very places where they are most urgently needed, low-income countries where a large share of the people experiencing poverty live2. Such delays can have severe consequences, forcing households to choose between going hungry or taking on costly debt, deepening their poverty. Digital payment systems are often hailed as a solution to payment delays, but they do not always resolve the issue, especially when manual approvals are still required3. Nonetheless, there is untapped potential in the data generated by digital payment systems. When used effectively, this data can enhance information flows within government agencies, enabling stronger oversight and more timely payments. However, whether these improvements materialize depends on the underlying cause of the delays. Are bureaucrats simply overburdened and lacking timely access to information? Or are they using the system to extract personal benefits, rather than to improve program performance?", "context_of_eval": "MGNREGS is one of India’s largest social protection programs, guaranteeing low-income, rural households up to 100 days of paid manual work each year. In 2024-25, over 70 million households participated in the program. 37 percent of workers belonged to scheduled castes and tribes, communities that have historically faced significant social and economic disadvantages, compared to 30 percent of the overall rural population. Women also played a key role, completing 55 percent of the total workdays, even as overall female labor force participation in India had declined to just 20 percent. MGNREGS is implemented by tens of thousands of officials, across three levels of bureaucratic hierarchy: Frontline officials who verify the work and request wage payments; Sub-district level officials who manage frontline officials and release wage payments; District-level officials who have an overarching administrative role over sub-districts. Persistent delays in wage payments undermine MGNREGS’ promise of providing timely income support4 5. The program mandates that initial wage processing be completed within 8 days of work. But prior to the study, the average processing time in the study’s states was 18 days. These delays matter: each extra day in initial wage processing was linked to nearly a full day’s delay in workers getting paid. Weak infrastructure further complicates implementation. Subdistrict officials in the study identified poor internet connectivity and frequent power outages as one of their top operational challenges. These issues slow down access to program data and make monitoring more difficult. They also reported that tracking performance required navigating hundreds of web pages, and that reformatting the data for decision-making added significantly to their workloads.", "details_inter": "India’s Ministry of Rural Development and researchers conducted a randomized evaluation of PayDash, a web-and mobile-based platform designed to improve how wage payments are tracked under MGNREGS. PayDash uses automatic timestamps from the government’s information system to record when key steps like work verification and payment processing are completed. The platform allowed bureaucrats to view data on the number and length of payment delays, as well as the contact information of the specific official responsible for the delays. While this information is accessible through the existing MGNREGS website, PayDash makes it much easier for bureaucrats to access real-time information about program implementation. Additionally, the PayDash mobile app is also built to work in areas with poor internet or mobile connectivity, allowing users to access the latest available data from their last online session. The evaluation included over 1,200 bureaucrats and took place in 73 districts and 560 sub-districts in two states, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand. Each district was randomly assigned to be in one of four groups: Sub-district only (16 districts): Districts where only sub-district level officials received PayDash District only (17 districts): Districts where only district-level officials received PayDash Both sub-district and district (20 districts): Districts where both sub-district and district-level officials received PayDash Comparison (20 districts): Districts where no officials received PayDash PayDash was launched in Madhya Pradesh in February and March 2017, and in Jharkhand in October 2017. The evaluation ended in August 2018. As part of the rollout, researchers organized half-day sessions to conduct baseline surveys and train officials. All officials, regardless of whether they were assigned to use PayDash, received a refresher training on how to access MGNREGS data through the existing government website. Officials who were assigned to use PayDash received an additional hour of training, during which they installed the mobile app and learned how to use its features. Researchers drew on a range of data sources to measure the impact of PayDash. Usage was tracked using Google Analytics. Administrative data from over 17 million MGNREGS attendance registers were analyzed to assess wage payment processing times. Community demand for work and corruption was examined through government-led social audits. Additionally, data on the postings of district and sub-district officials were collected through phone-based tracking.", "results_lessons": "Overall, PayDash reduced wage payment delays, increased the number of active worksites, and increased household participation in MGNREGS. Its impact primarily came from making real-time payment processing information more accessible to bureaucrats. PayDash usage: When only district officials had access to PayDash, they used the platform an average of 5.4 times per month. This was slightly higher than the 4.3 sessions per month observed when only sub-district officials had access. When both district and sub-district officials had access, usage by sub-district officials remained similar, regardless of whether district officials also had access. Payment processing speed: In sub-districts with PayDash, officials processed wage payments 17 percent (1.4 days) faster than those in the comparison group. Faster processing also helped make payment timelines more consistent, reducing variation by 13 percent (0.6 days), relative to variation in the comparison group. MGNREGS participation: In sub-districts where PayDash was provided, households worked 10 percent more days per month relative to the comparison group, adding up to 1,700 additional days of work per sub-district each month. This was driven by the fact that PayDash increased active worksites by 23 percent, especially during the agricultural lean season when job options were limited. Mechanism of impacts: PayDash had similar effects whether provided to sub-district or district level officials. These results help distinguish between two ways PayDash could be used: to reduce wage payment delays or to extract rents. If officials struggled to obtain timely information, then providing PayDash to either sub-district or district level officials would lead to similar improvements. But if sub-district officials were misusing information by colluding with frontline officials to extract rents, then limiting PayDash access to district level officials would be more effective. The similar effects across both levels suggest that the main barrier to implementation was limited access to information, not rent-seeking behavior. Moreover, social audit data that tracked financial misappropriation showed no increase in corruption from PayDash access. Bureaucratic transfers: District officials can manage sub-district officer performance by transferring them between posts. These transfers typically serve as a form of punishment for poor program outcomes, can be costly for sub-district officers, and are disruptive to program delivery. In districts where district officials had access to PayDash, transfers of sub-district officials dropped by 11 percentage points (a 24 percent reduction). This suggests that PayDash may have helped district officials gain stronger knowledge on sub-district officer actions and thereby condition transfers on their effort rather than program outcomes. When compared to hiring additional staff, the main alternative for speeding up wage payments, PayDash delivered similar benefits at just 1 percent of the cost in its first year. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that for every $1 invested in PayDash, households saved over $7 in interest payments and gained 63 additional days of paid work, resulting in more than $165 in extra wages per household. Drawing on the results from the study and with support from J-PAL’s Innovation in Government Initiative, PayDash is now being integrated into central government systems to enable nationwide scale-up.

However, uptake was low in low-income countries, where fewer than 30 percent of households had a television, fewer than 50 percent owned a radio, and fewer than 20 percent had internet access as of 2020. 3 Against this backdrop, mobile phones emerged as a more accessible option for reaching students.

Phone call tutorials: In addition to the weekly texts, students received one-on-one 20-minute phone tutorials each week. Drawing on the Teaching at the Right Level pedagogy, instructors tailored lessons to each student’s learning level based on weekly assessments, focusing on foundational math skills like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Comparison group: Students in this group did not receive either intervention. The evaluations included the three groups in all countries except India, which did not have an SMS-only group.

Randomization also differed with settings: in India, Nepal, and Uganda, all groups were randomized at the household level; in the Philippines, NGO-led implementation was randomized at the household level, while government-led implementation was randomized at the school-grade level; and in Kenya, the phone call tutorial group was randomized at the school-grade level, while the SMS-only group was cross-randomized at the household level. To measure impacts, researchers conducted phone surveys at the program’s start and a few months after completion. Surveys included short learning assessments for students, covering two-digit addition and subtraction, multiplication, and division, which were measured on a scale of 0–4. To assess non-cognitive skills, students who had completed a riddle were asked whether they wanted to attempt a second riddle, a measure of perseverance, and whether they preferred a more challenging riddle, a measure of ambition. Caregivers were asked how often they did educational activities with their child in the previous three weeks. In Nepal, a supplementary survey asked government teachers if they tailored feedback to students based on their individual learning levels. During the evaluation, a typhoon named Typhoon Rai hit the Philippines, which destroyed 4,000 classrooms and further disrupted learning and schooling for 2 million children. Researchers tracked which students were affected and found that the original random assignment still held, allowing them to assess if the program was effective in this additional emergency.", "results_lessons": "Mobile phone instruction supported learning during school closures, especially when tutoring calls and SMS messages were offered together. SMS messages alone were only effective where access to learning was particularly low. The results reported below reflect the average effect across all countries in the study unless otherwise specified. Program engagement: Over 95 percent of households in the phone tutoring group answered at least one call. Week after week, engagement stayed consistent, with 70–80 percent of households taking part in the tutoring sessions. Impact on student learning: The combination of phone tutoring and SMS messaging increased student learning in addition, subtraction, multiplication and division by an average of 0.33 standard deviations (SD), with more pronounced improvements in the Philippines (0.45 SD) and Uganda (0.89 SD). In both countries, schools were closed for nearly two years, and students in the comparison group had very limited access to education. Students who received SMS messages alone saw a more modest impact of 0.08 SD on average. Gains were driven solely by impacts in Uganda (0.21 SD) and the Philippines (0.09 SD), suggesting that SMS-based learning is more likely to make a difference in settings where education is more constrained. The program helped all children make progress regardless of their initial skill level. NGO vs government delivery: In Nepal and the Philippines, learning gains were similar whether the program was implemented by government teachers or NGO tutors, indicating that governments can deliver the program just as effectively as NGOs. Impacts on non-cognitive skills: Students who received phone tutoring were 2.9 percentage points more likely to try another riddle (from a comparison group rate of 83.3 percent) and 6.2 percentage points more likely to choose a harder one (from a comparison group rate of 21.1 percent), suggesting improvements in perseverance and ambition. SMS messages alone had no impact on these outcomes. Impact on teacher and caregiver behavior: In the phone tutoring group in Nepal, teachers were 9.3 percentage points more likely to tailor their lessons to the student's learning levels (from a 77 percent likelihood in the comparison group). Across both SMS and phone tutoring groups, and all countries, parents were 4 percentage points more likely to do education activities with their children (from an 87 percent likelihood in the comparison group). Impact during the Typhoon Rai: For students impacted by Typhoon Rai in the Philippines, phone tutoring increased student learning by an average of 0.26 SD relative to the comparison group, indicating that phone tutoring can remain effective across different education crises. However, SMS messages alone did not prevent learning losses. Cost-effectiveness: The combined phone tutoring and SMS program is estimated to cost 11 USD per child. This intervention is associated with 3.9 Learning Adjusted Years of Schooling 5 per 100 USD spent, positioning it among the top 10 of 150 educational interventions analyzed in low- and middle-income countries. 6 Taken together, these results suggest that targeted phone call tutorials are an effective and scalable method to deliver education during emergencies, across different contexts and via government systems. Researchers attribute the program’s success to the high levels of engagement relative to interventions that leverage other remote learning platforms like radio or TV and the tailored pedagogical approach. In partnership with governments, Youth Impact is currently scaling the phone tutoring intervention in Botswana, India and the Philippines. In India, the Government of Karnataka has committed to expanding the phone tutoring program to reach over 1 million students through government school teachers. 7 In the Philippines, the program has scaled to 20 school division offices, with the potential to reach 20,000 students. 8", "citations": "", "run_id": "2026-02-24 182618", "scraped_at": "2026-02-24T18:30:52", "hash": "1cded9ef9ee21a3899f73c8e133690fde427cb3dfb1ff7ab866e7f84318aacb8"}

However, governments in fragile states often lack the capacity to collect enough taxes and to efficiently manage public spending. Where their capacity is limited, governments sometimes delegate tax collection to local elites instead of using state officials. Today, many sub-Saharan African countries engage local elites in tax collection. Delegating tax collection to local elites comes with advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, local elites usually have better information on local people, and costs are lower for governments because fewer tax offices are required. On the other hand, it is harder for the government to control local elites, which could come with increased potential for misalignment and corruption. Should governments in fragile states delegate their tax collection responsibilities to local elites to raise more revenue?", "context_of_eval": "The evaluation took place in the city of Kananga in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). With a population of almost 2 million inhabitants, in 2016 the average household in Kananga had a monthly income of US$106. Prior to the evaluation, the provincial government had tax revenues equal to about US$0.30 per person per year and provided few, low-quality public infrastructures and services. To increase tax revenues, the government held citywide property tax collection campaigns in 2016 and 2018. The government, in collaboration with researchers, used the 2018 property tax campaign to evaluate whether tax collection was higher when done by local elites with local knowledge compared to state actors belong to the central tax ministry. Local elites are city chiefs that are key members of their community, they mediate disputes and support the upkeep of local infrastructure. Chiefs are not paid a regular salary and typically maintain other roles (e.g., teacher, pastor). They often serve as chiefs for life.", "details_inter": "In collaboration with the provincial government of Kasaï-Central, researchers conducted a randomized evaluation to study if a local government with limited capacity could strengthen its tax systems by delegating tax collection to local elites in an urban setting. After the first property tax campaign in 20161, the provincial government of Kasai-Central hypothesized that involving local city chiefs in tax collection might grow revenues further. To test this idea, the researchers assisted in randomizing the type of tax collector assigned to collector in each neighborhood in the 2018 property tax campaign. The campaign had two steps: property registration and tax visits. During the property registration stage, collectors allocated a unique tax ID and judged each property’s tax liability. If households could not pay the respective tax at that time, the collectors scheduled follow-up appointments. The collectors were instructed to return to the household until they paid taxes. They had one month to finish the work in each neighborhood and were allocated one to two neighborhoods per month. Collectors worked in groups of two. The researchers randomly assigned 356 neighborhoods in the city of Kananga, including 45,162 properties, to five different groups differing in the identity of the tax collector and their access to local knowledge: 1. Central (110 neighborhoods, 14,489 properties): Fifty state collectors were responsible for tax collection. 2. Local (111 neighborhoods, 14,383 properties): One hundred eleven local city chiefs were responsible for tax collection. 3. Central + Local Information, CLI (80 neighborhoods, 9,422 properties): Same as Central, but chiefs also shared property owner information with state collectors after the property registration. 4. Central X Local, CXL (50 neighborhoods, 6,071 properties): In this group, one state collector and one chief worked together. Everything else remained the same. 5. Pure Comparison (5 neighborhoods, 797 properties): A few neighborhoods kept the system from before 2016, in which state collectors registered the property, assigned an ID, and distributed tax letters, which instructed the owner to pay taxes at the ministry, without further follow-ups. The focus of the study was on comparing the Central and Local groups. Administrative data (property registration data and payment records) as well as three household surveys were used to study the effect of the type of tax collector on tax compliance. The property tax campaign took place from May to December 2018, and the household surveys were carried out in three rounds from July 2017 to September 2019.", "results_lessons": "Researchers found that households were more tax compliant in neighborhoods where local chiefs collected taxes compared to those where state collectors collected, due to local information that chiefs possessed on households. Tax compliance and revenues: In neighborhoods where local chiefs collected taxes (“the Local” group), tax compliance was 9.5 percent, compared to 6.3 percent in neighborhoods where state collectors were responsible for the property tax campaign (the “Central” group), a 50.8 percent increase. This increased compliance translated into 44 percent higher property tax revenue. One concern with delegating tax collection to local elites is that it could encourage corruption and weaken trust in government. Despite concerns about mismanagement, chiefs were more likely to properly exempt vulnerable households (e.g., elderly people or people with disabilities) and were less likely to incorrectly assign a property value classification than state collectors, suggesting respect for the tax campaign’s rules and processes. However, chiefs were slightly more likely than state collectors to be paid bribes. In spite of this, researchers found no differences between chief and state tax collection neighborhoods in terms of views of government, trust in tax authorities, perceived fairness of property taxation, tax morale, or perceptions of tax enforcement, suggesting that delegating tax collection to local chiefs did not negatively impact peoples’ perceptions of government over the short term. Local information: Chiefs’ local information helped identify households more likely to pay property taxes. In addition to neighborhoods where local chiefs collected taxes, neighborhoods where city chiefs shared property owner information with state collectors (the “Central + Local Information” group) also saw improved tax collection compared to areas where state collectors were responsible for tax collection without such information. Without knowledge of local residents, state collectors had to rely on visible signs, like house quality, when deciding which households to visit when collecting taxes. Chiefs, using their local knowledge of non-visible characteristics like cash availability or attitudes toward taxes, targeted owners of lower-quality homes who were more willing and able to pay. Cost-effectiveness: Letting local chiefs collect taxes was more cost-effective than state collection. In areas where local chiefs handled tax collection, each US$1 spent on administration brought in 53 percent more return than in areas with state collectors, thanks to higher revenues and lower costs. Overall, in fragile and low-capacity settings, governments may gain in the short term by working together with local elites to collect taxes in cities.", "citations": "Balán, Pablo, Augustin Bergeron, Gabriel Tourek, and Jonathan L.

The conventional debt-based model of microcredit, characterized by rigid repayment plans and high-interest rates, often fails to stimulate the growth of high-potential but risky microenterprises. Flexible microfinance contracts—relying on performance-based loan repayment rules—offer a viable alternative for microentrepreneurs. Such contracts link repayments to business earnings; in this way, they represent a more collaborative relationship between lenders and entrepreneurs than the relationship offered by traditional debt-based financing. This more flexible form of financing could encourage riskier yet potentially more successful investments. Do performance-based repayment models improve on the traditional approach to microfinance, and generate better business outcomes and welfare gains than traditional microcredit?", "context_of_eval": "In Kenya, microentrepreneurs often lack access to formal employment opportunities. In a 2014-2015 qualitative survey, micro-distributors, or small-scale entrepreneurs who deliver consumer goods like food and beverages to local shops, also cited the lack of transportation as a key constraint to business productivity. Owning a bicycle allowed micro-distributors to expand their sales networks, reaching customers farther from their stockpoints. In particular, distributors with bicycles generated a much larger share of profits from shops located farther away, showing that bicycles enabled geographical expansion. Program participants were micro-distributors who sold chewing gum products and other goods. The average age was 31, 85 percent were male, and seventy percent were married. On average, they earned about Ks 13,300 per month (roughly US$130 in 2018). The program was implemented in partnership with FoodCo, a major global food manufacturer. FoodCo largely recruited and trained the micro-distributors and supplied the products they sold. This collaboration reflects a trend of private sector companies helping expand last-mile distribution networks in underserved markets.", "details_inter": "Between 2017 and 2020 in partnership with FoodCo, researchers conducted a randomized evaluation to understand how different financing options affected the business growth of micro-distributors in Kenya. The 161 micro-distributors were randomly assigned to one of four financing contracts or a comparison group. Each contract, if accepted, required an initial ten percent deposit, with the remaining ninety percent financed by a local lender. The contracts varied in repayment structure: Fixed monthly payment: Participants repaid the cost of the bicycle in equal installments over twelve months, with an added fifteen percent fee. Profit-based payments: Participants paid half the fixed monthly amount and added ten percent of their monthly earnings. This structure offered flexibility by lowering payments during slow months, but total payments could be higher if earnings were strong. Hybrid plan: Like the profit-based plan, the hybrid plan also combined fixed and earnings-based payments, but with a cap: once the total paid matched the cost of the fixed contract, no further payments were required. This cap limited the total cost and protected against high long-term payments. Community-based plan: Payments changed based on the average earnings of other distributors in the same region. This structure helped reduce the burden on micro-distributors if business was slow for everyone but did not discourage individual effort. Comparison group: Participants were not offered bicycle financing under any contract. They continued with their normal participation in the FoodCo micro-distribution program. All payments were made through Kenya’s widespread mobile money system, M-Pesa. Researchers measured outcomes including changes in business earnings, restocking frequency, sales expansion, business management improvements, loan repayment rates, and broader household impacts.", "results_lessons": "Micro-distributors who received flexible financing, especially the hybrid loan that adjusted payments based on earnings, saw higher profits. They also restocked more often, expanded their sales areas, managed their businesses better, and repaid their loans more. Financing uptake and debt: About 58 percent of micro-distributors accepted a financing contract, thus completing the required deposit and documentation to receive a bicycle. Take-up rates varied by contract type: around 69 percent of those offered hybrid and fixed contracts opted in, while approximately 47–49 percent accepted profit-based and community-based contracts. Business performance: Micro-distributors who financed bicycles nearly doubled their monthly profits over three years,, primarily by selling more products and reaching more customers. Those who adopted earnings-linked contracts, saw the highest gains, consistently outperforming those with fixed-payment debt contracts. The hybrid plan led to an increase of KES 1,528.51 from a base of KES 897.45 (a 170.3 percent increase, or about US$14.70 from a base of US$8.63), while the profit-based plan increased profits by KES 781.65 (an 87.1 percent increase, or about US$7.52). GPS tracking showed that financed micro-distributors traveled further and restocked more frequently, supporting sustained increases in sales. Researchers suggest that flexible repayment structures allowed participants to prioritize business growth without the constraints of fixed payments, contributing to steady, higher earnings. Contract repayment: Micro-distributors with hybrid and profit-based repayment plans repaid more of their loans over time. By the sixth month, those in the hybrid and profit-based plans were making higher payments than those in with fixed payments, reflecting stronger business growth. By month fifteen, repayment rates under these plans were higher (78–81 percent) compared to those in the fixed and community-based plans (58–59 percent). Researchers suggest that the ability to adjust payments based on earnings helped micro-distributors stay on track, while rigid repayment schedules made it harder to keep up. Cost-effectiveness: A cost-benefit analysis found increased returns and operating income across all stakeholders, including distributors, FoodCo, stock sellers, and lenders. Across all financing contracts, the benefits of the program exceeded its costs, and the earnings-linked financing model was the most cost-effective during the study period. Taken together, these findings suggest that flexible repayment structures can help small business owners grow their enterprises while also bringing benefits to suppliers and lenders.

Researchers noted that participants may not have believed the information regarding infant mortality due to personal experience, or that political instability or Covid-19 may have minimized progress. These findings are informative for current policy debates, as subsidized access to modern contraception is a central focus of women’s empowerment programs globally.

Technical tool group: Factories in this group received only a digitized assessment, replacing the traditional paper-based test. While their standard hiring process remained unchanged, the new tablet-based evaluation provided a standardized measure of technical skills, ensuring consistency in hiring and promotion decisions.

They mainly trade small quantities of goods and transport their products via foot or bicycle. On the other hand, the majority of large-scale traders are men, in part because they have better access to transportation like trucks to move large quantities of goods across the border. Informal traders buy and sell goods in markets on both sides of the Kenya-Ugandan border, yet over 80 percent of informal traders always sell in the same market.

Saving Groups (SGs) present a potential solution. Composed of 10-25 people from a community, members of SGs save their own money and lend it out to each other to earn interest. SGs avoid many common pitfalls of other microloan systems. Members don’t have to travel to a bank or pay fees for an account. SGs can offer flexibility in repayment terms. SGs often have high repayment rates and low default rates in part because the members of the SG come from the same community and therefore hold each other socially accountable which banks cannot do. However, SGs face a crucial problem: they have limited funding at the beginning of each cycle. Since they are self-funded, SGs rely on their members’ savings to give out loans, and these savings add up throughout the year, culminating in an annual payout to each member. After the payout, the groups are left with much less communal capital, limiting the amount of loans available to members at the beginning of the next cycle.

About 37 percent of Ugandan adults belonged to an SG in 2020.2 These groups are an essential way for people to access loans. However, only about halfway through their annual cycle do most SGs in Uganda have enough funds to meet the needs of their members. The evaluation took place in Nkozi, a rural sub-county in central Uganda. Seventy percent of participants were women, 76 percent were married, and almost all worked in agriculture. Many women reported experiencing debt during their lifetime and about 70 percent had taken out a loan from their SG before the study.

Comparison group (1,022 members across 46 SGs): SGs did not receive any outside funds. Researchers surveyed members before and after the study to measure how additional funds affected the number of loans SGs gave out, how much money each member collected at the end of the year, and whether the members failed to pay or delayed repaying their loans. The researchers also collected data on education, access to healthcare, and work-related activities.

As a group, members did not reduce their total savings and were not more likely to default or make delayed payments. Loans: Members whose SG groups received outside money were 8 percentage points more likely to take out a loan relative to the comparison group where 68 percent took out a loan (an 11.76 percent increase). This indicates how additional funds were needed for SGs to supply loans to all members who requested them. Default and delays: SGs that received additional capital were no more likely to have a member default on their loans relative to the comparison group, in which 69 percent of SGs had a member default. Researchers suggest that the infusion of cash did not cause members to make riskier choices. Payouts: Members of SGs who received additional funds ended the year with a UGX 74,000 (US$20 in 2021) higher average payout. The group’s average total payout was higher than the total amount of outside money supplementing the SGs. This indicates the capital could continue to be reinvested and grow allowing SG members to take out more loans in future years. Cost-analysis: Assuming the external capital is reinvested into the SGs every year, after five years, researchers predict an economic rate-of-return of 61 percent, making the program more cost-effective over several years than many forms of direct cash transfer.

People experiencing poverty face difficulty affording basic necessities like food, housing, transportation, childcare, and health care. Many safety net programs address each of these issues in isolation and may fall short of addressing the compounding effects of multiple, simultaneous hardships. Moreover, administrative burdens can make these programs difficult to navigate. In response, intensive case management has emerged as a promising strategy to help individuals navigate and address interconnected barriers to securing stable economic footing. While previous evaluations have focused on the effectiveness of case management in specific domains—such as mental health services, homelessness prevention, or workforce development—there is less evidence on whether more comprehensive, person-centered models can produce meaningful, long-term improvements across multiple indicators of well-being. The Padua program seeks to fill this gap by offering intensive, customized case management that supports individuals in identifying goals and accessing services tailored to their unique needs. This study builds on existing literature by evaluating the effectiveness of a holistic intervention model that reflects the complexity of poverty, aiming to understand whether such an approach can lead to sustained improvements in housing and labor market outcomes.", "context_of_eval": "In Tarrant County, Texas, 62 percent of the working-age population is currently employed, 30 percent receive SNAP benefits, and the average monthly earnings are US$767. Researchers partnered with Catholic Charities Fort Worth (CCFW)—a large urban service provider based in Tarrant County serving more than 50,000 clients annually as of 2019—to evaluate the impact of their Padua program. CCFW aims to support clients, primarily low-income working-age adults, in achieving four primary milestones toward economic stability: achieving a living wage, reducing reliance on transfer programs, decreasing debt, and increasing personal savings. Most individuals who request assistance from CCFW are seeking emergency financial assistance, likely as a result of an unexpected economic shock (e.g., job loss, eviction). Padua targets working-age adults who face barriers to economic mobility, such as low education, excessive debt, difficulty finding childcare, or an unstable living situation. Because Padua aimed to improve labor market outcomes, eligibility for the program required individuals to be willing and able to work. Padua takes a comprehensive approach to supporting clients, focusing on five key elements: A thorough in-take assessment to understand each participant's unique goals and challenges The development of a customized strength-based service plan A two-person case management team with small caseloads Flexible financial assistance Full, personalized case management services including referrals to a broad network of external services and resources for employment, education, transportation, immigration, and housing", "details_inter": "Researchers conducted a randomized evaluation to test the impact of Padua on housing stability, labor market outcomes, participation in public programs, debt and savings, spending, and health. Researchers recruited study participants from a pool of clients who had previously contacted the agency’s central intake system for emergency financial assistance for rent or utilities, immigration services, or other available programs. To be eligible for the Padua evaluation, individuals had to be between 18 and 55 years of age, have a total family income not sufficient to meet their needs, reside in Tarrant County, Texas, and have at least one working-age adult in their family who was willing and able to work. From March 2015 to October 2016, 427 eligible individuals were randomized to receive the Padua programming (“treatment group”) or the standard CCFW services (“comparison group”) which they originally sought. Take-up among those offered Padua was 91 percent. At baseline, the treatment and comparison groups were balanced, with no significant differences in key demographic factors such as age, education level, or employment. The study population was diverse, with participants facing varying levels of need—whether related to housing instability, employment challenges, or financial stress. Researchers collected administrative data and fielded a series of in-person surveys at enrollment, 12 months after enrollment, and 24 months after enrollment. Data for the primary outcomes (labor market, housing, participation in public programs, debt and savings, spending, and health) was collected through the surveys. Administrative data on earnings and employment, government program participation, and credit usage, was supplemental to the primary survey analysis. The study leveraged cost data from CCFW to assess the program’s cost-effectiveness.", "results_lessons": "The Padua intervention did not demonstrate significant impacts on employment, housing, reliance on public programs, debt and savings, or spending for low-income individuals overall. Considering that individuals faced a range of barriers at the program outset and each had unique goals, average treatment effects may mask important variations in how different individuals responded to the program. Labor Market Overall, there was no statistically significant effect of Padua on labor market outcomes for the full participating sample, though the estimated treatment effects indicated improved labor market outcomes before multiple hypothesis testing. Additionally, exploratory analyses suggested that treatment group participants who were not employed at the start of the intervention were 67 percent more likely to be employed at a full-time job 24 months after the intervention began (a 19.3 percentage point increase relative to the comparison group mean of 28.9). Housing Overall, there was no statistically significant effect of Padua on housing outcomes for the full participating sample, though treatment effects suggest that Padua led to improved housing outcomes before multiple hypothesis testing. Additionally, exploratory analyses suggest that, among those who were unstably housed at the start of the intervention, Padua programming increased the fraction of individuals in a lease or ownership arrangement by 34 percentage points (a 64 percent increase relative to the comparison group mean of 53.5) 24 months after the intervention began. Those who were stably housed at baseline demonstrated no change in housing outcomes at this point, which aligns with the program's focus on addressing each individual's most urgent needs first. Participation in Public Programs A key goal of the Padua program is to help participants reduce their dependence on public assistance programs, such as SNAP, TANF, Medicaid, and WIC. Overall, there was no statistically significant effect of Padua on reducing reliance on public programs for the full participating sample. However, there were significant results for certain subgroups. Treatment group participants who were stably housed at baseline were 0.09 standard deviations less likely to be participating in government programs at the 24-month follow up, relative to those who were stably housed at baseline and not randomized to participate in Padua. Among those who were not employed but stably housed at baseline, Padua participants were 0.13 standard deviations less likely to be participating in government programs at the 24-month follow up relative to those not randomized to participate in Padua. Debt and Savings Overall, Padua had no statistically significant effect on debt or savings outcomes for the full participating sample or identified subgroups. Spending Overall, there was no statistically significant effect of Padua on spending outcomes for the full participating sample and identifiable subgroups. However, Padua seemed to help participants improve their budgeting habits. Participation in Padua increased the likelihood that participants were using a budget 24 months after enrollment by 14 percentage points (a 24 percent increase relative to the comparison group mean of 59 percent). The effects were even larger among specific subgroups—the likelihood of using a budget for those who were not employed at baseline increased by 23 percentage points (a 39 percent increase relative to comparison group mean of 60 percent) and by 34 percentage points for those who were unstably housed at baseline (a 54 percent increase relative to a comparison mean of 63 percent). Health Overall, there was no statistically significant effect of Padua on health, insurance coverage, ER visits, and doctor visits for the full participating sample. On self-reported measures, those who participated in Padua were 14.7 percentage points more likely to report improved or excellent health in the 24-month survey (a 53 percent increase relative to the comparison group mean of 28). Cost-effectiveness Researchers estimate the marginal value of public funds (MVPF) using estimates for the participant willingness to pay (after-tax earnings gains combined with the financial assistance received through the program) and the total cost of administering the program, to assess the cost-effectiveness of the Padua program. The MVPF of the Padua program, without incorporating projected future earnings, is estimated to be 0.18, meaning that for every US$1 of funds spent on the program, US$0.18 benefits the participants. When assuming that the effects of the program persist for another five years, the MVPF increases to about US$0.26. Exploratory subgroup analyses suggest that the program may be more cost-effective when targeted at specific populations. Estimates for MVPFs for those without employment, those with stable housing, and those without employment and with stable housing yield higher estimates, ranging from US$0.3 to US$0.5 when relying on experimental estimates and ranging from US$1 to US$5.8 when assuming gains persist into the future. – While certain subgroups (such as those unemployed or unstably housed at baseline) likely benefited from Padua in the areas that they most needed support, the absence of effects across the full sample suggests the intervention may have a greater impact if targeted toward certain subgroup populations. Moreover, Padua’s highly individualized, wrap-around approach makes it difficult to isolate which specific components of the intervention are driving the observed impacts. Notably, the strongest treatment effects were observed among individuals facing multiple, compounding barriers to self-sufficiency. Refining intake procedures to better identify and prioritize high-need clients could enhance program impact and cost-effectiveness. At the same time, the diversity in participants' needs and outcomes highlights a key challenge. Future research should consider collecting data on participants’ self-identified goals and track progress toward those goals over time. Doing so could offer a more personalized and meaningful measure of success, while also providing insights into how well the program meets the diverse needs of its participants.", "citations": "Evans, William N., Shawna Kolka, James X.

CBT may also help older adults overcome functional impairments and more easily complete daily tasks by equipping them with skills to address everyday problems, sustain relationships, and improve their emotional wellbeing. Despite its effectiveness, many low- and middle-income countries lack licensed therapists to administer CBT due to limited funding and training opportunities. In these contexts, in-person therapy delivered by non-professionals has been shown to lower symptoms of depression. While talk therapy delivered remotely by non-professionals has been found to be effective at treating depression among older adults in high-income countries, no such evidence is available for older adults in low-income countries.

To be eligible for this evaluation, adults had to be aged 55 or older, accessible by phone, and living alone. Approximately 83 percent of participants were women, and 77.1 percent were widowed. A majority of participants (75 percent) lived in rural communities. Researchers found that about a third of participants were moderately or severely depressed and over 20 percent were mildly depressed. Adults in the study had low incomes, with an average monthly spending of INR 1,699 (US$20 in 2021). Nearly a quarter of participants reported skipping or cutting meals in 2018.

They randomly assigned 1,120 adults aged 55 or older living alone in Tamil Nadu to one of four groups: Phone-based CBT group (377 older adults): Participants agreed to join weekly 30- to 45-minute phone calls with CBT-trained lay counselors over six consecutive weeks. They could also join an additional booster session two months after the weekly program ended. Non-professional counselors, trained over two weeks in a specialized curriculum, helped participants brainstorm solutions to daily challenges and identify and plan activities that would boost their mood. The CBT curriculum was developed by a psychologist at Sangath, a mental health nonprofit.6 Cash transfer group (184 older adults): Participants could receive a one-time unconditional cash transfer of INR 1,000 (US$12 in 2021), delivered in-person. On average, comparison group participants spent INR 1,747 (US$21 in 2021) before the study began, making the cash transfer equivalent to 57 percent of their monthly spending.7 Phone-based CBT and cash transfer group (183 older adults): Participants could join the same phone-based CBT program described above, and received the same cash transfer of (INR 1,000, US$12 in 2021) one week after the CBT sessions ended. Cash was delivered regardless of participants’ participation in the CBT sessions. Comparison group (376 older adults): Participants in the comparison group were not offered the phone-based CBT sessions or the cash transfer. Participants in each group began receiving phone-based CBT, a one-time cash transfer, both, or neither in three waves starting in January, March, or August 2021. Due to a rise in Covid-19 cases across India in spring 2021, cash could not be delivered in the second wave, and hence there is only a comparison group and CBT group in that wave. Researchers collected information on participants’ functional impairment, feelings of depression, and food security about three weeks and three months after the end of the CBT in their wave. Researchers measured participants’ ability to perform daily tasks by asking them to rate their difficulty performing twelve activities of daily living in the past month. Results were scored from 0 (no functional impairment) to 48 (extreme functional impairment) points. Researchers measured depression by asking participants fifteen yes or no questions on their current mental well-being. Results were scored from 0 (least depressed) to 15 (most depressed) points. Researchers measured food security by asking participants if they had to skip a meal or reduce meal size in the past week.", "results_lessons": "One-time cash transfers reduced functional impairment for older adults living alone in Tamil Nadu three weeks later, and led to a small decline in feelings of depression. Neither cash transfers, CBT, nor the combination of the two had an impact on outcomes at three months. Functional impairment: At three weeks, participants who received a cash transfer experienced a decreased effect on their functional impairment of 2.9 points relative to the comparison group. A lower score indicates that participants were better able to perform daily tasks. The CBT and combined groups did not impact people’s functional impairment, and the effect of cash had faded by three months. Among older women, cash transfers, phone-based CBT, and their combination reduced functional impairment in the short term. At three weeks, women who received cash, CBT, or both experienced decreased functional impairment effects of 4.1, 3.5, and -3.2 points, respectively, relative to the comparison group. Among older men, phone-based CBT, cash transfers, and their combination worsened functional impairment at three months. The researchers highlight the importance of further study to explore why CBT and cash transfers appeared to affect men negatively and in differing ways to women. Depression: People who received cash transfers experienced a small improvement in depression symptoms three weeks after the program, with a 1 point greater decrease on their depression score relative to the comparison group. The other two interventions showed no impact at three weeks, and none of the treatments led to improvements at the three-month follow-up. This contrasts with other studies which find that CBT reduced depression among older adults in India and in high-income countries.8 The effect of cash on depression at three weeks is driven by women, who enjoyed a 1.4 point greater decrease on their depression score. Since the average woman in the study was mildly depressed at the start, this reduction implies that on average women in the cash transfer group fell below the threshold for depression diagnosis. Food security: None of the interventions affected food security three weeks or three months after they ended. Overall, the interventions studied here had limited impacts on functional impairment, depression, and food security. Cash transfers appear to be more cost-effective than phone-based CBT as they generated short-run improvements in functional impairment and depression, and were less expensive (cash cost US$12 per person compared to US$19 for CBT). The impacts on depression align with other findings that cash transfers can improve mental health.

Little is known about land formalization in sub-Saharan African cities, where land is more valuable and reliance on social institutions is weaker than in rural settings. In Kananga, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), researchers conducted a randomized evaluation to test the impact of a subsidized land titling program on both starting and completing land registration, as well as on citizens’ participation in social institutions. Being offered a land titling subsidy substantially increased the number of citizens who began the property registration process and obtained a land title, while decreasing participation in social institutions and worsening citizens’ evaluations of chiefs.", "policy_issue": "Property rights are considered crucial for economic development and good governance. However, they remain rare, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where only about 10 percent of land is formally titled. Weak property rights may discourage citizens from investing because of fears of expropriation. Given their importance, organizations such as the World Bank have supported land registration campaigns in low- and middle-income countries. Yet despite these efforts, land formalization rates remain very low. Some argue that citizens may achieve tenure security informally through membership in social institutions and customary land rights, which can function as a substitute for formal titles. To understand the relationship between land titling and social institutions, there is a need to study the demand for formal titles in Africa more systematically.", "context_of_eval": "The DRC, often considered a fragile state, had the fourth largest population in Africa in 2023. The country also faces severe financial challenges, with weak fiscal capacity: its tax-to-GDP ratio ranked 188th out of 200 countries between 2000 and 2017. The evaluation took place in Kananga, the capital of Kasaï Central province. With a population of 1.6 million, Kananga is the 4th-largest city in the DRC. The average monthly income there is US$106. As in the rest of the country, Kananga’s fiscal capacity is weak and land formalization rates are low. In 2017, fewer than 16 percent of residents held formal land titles. Like other African cities, Kananga is urbanizing rapidly, driving up property prices: the average property value among participants in the intervention was US$5,700. Despite rising property values, most citizens refrain from obtaining a title because the process is burdensome and costly. Some citizens reported paying 10 times more than the official price of a title. The lack of formal land titles creates problems for both citizens and the government. Kananga’s residents remain at risk of dispossession—more than 25 percent of study participants reported a legal dispute over property. Citizens also had difficulty accessing formal finance because they lacked property titles for collateral. Like many African cities, Kananga’s property rights regime is fragmented, with an urban core surrounded by peripheral areas—known as chefferies—where state presence is weak and customary land rights are presided over by chiefs. As elsewhere in Africa, citizens of Kananga are embedded in a dense network of social institutions. They routinely participate in churches, mutual aid societies, and Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCAs), and contribute to community events such as weddings and funerals. Past research on rural Africa shows such institutions can provide informal insurance. Local elites, known as avenue chiefs, are also prominent, and prior work highlights their role in land governance. For this reason, some argue participation in these institutions may substitute for formal land rights. A crucial question is therefore how participation in these institutions shapes the demand for formal land titles in urban settings.", "details_inter": "In partnership with the Provincial Government of Kasaï Central, researchers conducted a randomized evaluation that offered citizens the opportunity to obtain land titles at a reduced price for a limited period. Randomization was conducted at the household level in 364 neighborhoods using satellite imagery. After changes in government eligibility requirements, 483 households qualified for the program and were randomly assigned to either the subsidy group or the comparison group. In the subsidy group, 254 households were offered a subsidy to cover land title costs. At the time of the study, the official price of a land title was US$100. Within the subsidy group, households could choose among three formal land titles at reduced prices: Certificat d’Enregistrement (CE): a formal land title conferring the highest legal recognition of property ownership. The average subsidized price was US$75—a 92.5 percent reduction from costs of up to US$1,000. Contrat de Location: a three-year contract between the citizen and the government, which can lead to a CE if citizens make annual payments over three years. The average subsidized price was US$40. Acte de Vente Notarié: a document providing proof of land acquisition. The average subsidized price was US$20. In the comparison group, 229 households still had the option of obtaining a land title through the regular procedure. Prior to the intervention, a baseline survey (July–December 2017) collected information on urban chiefs, public goods, property characteristics, demographics, governance, experiences with taxation and payments to the state, political beliefs, and participation in social institutions. After the program ended, the research team conducted two endline surveys with property owners (March 2019–February 2020). These surveys asked about views of and engagement with the government and city chiefs, participation in social institutions, and tenure security. Researchers also drew on administrative data from Kasaï Central’s cadastral and land titling offices. Ethical Considerations. In addition to approval from an institutional review board, researchers sought and obtained local ethical approval from the University of Notre-Dame du Kasaï, Kananga’s oldest university. In his letter of support, the University’s academic dean wrote that the project “will help to understand the importance of private property,” adding that it “does not hurt the local culture.” As compensation, participants received about US$2 per survey hour.", "results_lessons": "The program’s design allows for the study of both the demand for land titles and their effects. Specifically, the researchers addressed two main questions: (1) Does reducing barriers to formalization increase demand for formal land titles? (2) How does land titling interact with citizens’ participation in social institutions? Starting the property registration process and receipt of land titles. Citizens randomly offered a subsidized land title were 44 percentage points (5,000 percent) more likely to initiate the titling process—a costly outcome in itself—compared to 1 percent in the comparison group. They were also 13.7 percentage points (3,100 percent) more likely to obtain a title, compared to nearly 0 percent in the comparison group. Demand for titles was higher among richer, more educated households, and those with higher-value properties. The gap between demand and actual receipt of a title likely reflects a combination of poor coordination across government offices, weak bureaucratic incentives, and the program’s logistical challenges. Overall, reducing the price and the barriers citizens face to obtaining a formal title reveals substantial latent demand for formalization, indicating the time and money required to secure a title discouraged citizens from pursuing formalization. However, this significant increase in program take-up masks results that varied depending on citizens’ participation in social institutions and their relationships with urban chiefs. Participation in social institutions. Citizens who were offered a land titling subsidy and who belonged to a mutual aid society, made contributions to churches, or contributed to weddings and funerals were more likely to start the land titling process relative to the comparison group. However, while participation in social institutions predicted demand for titles, it did not lead to a corresponding increase in the actual receipt of land titles. These results challenge the argument that participation in informal insurance institutions reduces demand for formal titling. Demand for formalization was, in fact, higher among citizens with higher baseline levels of participation in these institutions. Connections to chiefs. Citizens with closer connections to their local chiefs—for example, those who knew their chief’s name or whose chiefs were longtime residents of their community—were more likely to start the titling process. This suggests citizens saw chiefs as intermediaries who could help them get titles. However, other characteristics of chiefs affected citizens’ chances of obtaining a land title. Chiefs affiliated with a political party reduced citizens’ chances of getting a land title. While citizens may have believed chiefs could help them obtain land titles, chiefs’ incentives may conflict with citizens’ desire for titles. Social effects. The program affected citizens’ participation in and perceptions of the same institutions that shaped program take-up. First, being offered a land titling subsidy reduced citizens’ participation in ROSCAs by 7.5 percentage points (23.4 percent) relative to the comparison group average of 32 percent. The program also lowered church contributions by 9.1 percentage points (16.5 percent) relative to the comparison group average of 55 percent. Second, citizens offered the land titling program saw chiefs 16.8 percentage points (or 25 percent) less favorably relative to the comparison group’s average view of 67 percent. Together, these results indicate citizens exit social institutions when given the opportunity to formalize their land and cast doubt on the idea that formal titling and social institutions may be complements. Citizens of Kananga preferred land formalization to informal institutions, which they were willing to exit if they got titles. Formalization may offer citizens an exit option from informal institutions. Perhaps the most important lesson is that citizens have high demand for formal land property rights in Kananga, and yet are stymied in their efforts to obtain property titles by high prices, excessive red tape, and bureaucratic incentives. As urbanization proceeds at a sweeping pace in sub-Saharan Africa and land values continue to rise, cities face formalization bottlenecks. However, the significant increase in take-up induced by the program indicates that carefully designed reforms aimed at simplifying the land titling process and reducing bureaucratic discretion have the potential to significantly expand formalization. Reflecting this, in 2017, DRC’s government provided guidance about setting ceilings on prices for land titles and standardizing the process, in which the guidance resembled the intervention from this study. While based on a single-city intervention, these results can inform larger titling campaigns. Reforms that make the land titling process simpler and consider differences between urban and rural land formalization could be useful as sub-Saharan Africa continues to urbanize at a rapid pace.", "citations": "", "run_id": "2026-02-24 182618", "scraped_at": "2026-02-24T18:30:52", "hash": "5a49a79f23f8c4d566bfa157db00cb5e858f336b583a0edddf6e0099b82ceaa0"}

Results are forthcoming.", "policy_issue": "Deforestation is a critical issue across the globe, driving biodiversity loss and reducing the planet’s capacity to absorb carbon dioxide. Illegal logging and other exploitative forest activities contribute to the unsustainable use of natural resources1. The illicit trade in timber and forest products is fueled by a complex mix of factors, including weak forest governance and regulation enforcement in producer countries, insufficient verification standards in consumer countries, and sustained demand for forest products. Until recent decades, many natural woodlands in low-income countries such as Ethiopia were state-owned and effectively open-access, making them vulnerable to widespread exploitation and deforestation. In response, governments have explored using different forest management and governance systems, including community-based forest management (CBFM). These programs transfer management and extraction rights to local communities, aiming not only to conserve forests but also to create new sources of forest-based income. In turn, this income may enable smallholder farmers to invest more in their farms and boost productivity. Can community-based forestry interventions improve the livelihoods of participating smallholder farmers, while promoting forest conservation?", "context_of_eval": "Natural forests in Ethiopia were state-controlled and effectively open-access before the 1990s, leading to widespread illegal exploitation of resources. In Oromia regional state, home to seventy percent of Ethiopia’s woodlands, forests disappeared at a rate of three percent per year from 1950 to 1990. Since then, the Ethiopian government has sought to curb illegal forest extraction by devolving management authority to local communities through a CBFM program. Forest user groups (FUGs) were established and granted exclusive rights to extract and trade timber and non-timber resources in areas they managed. Today, more than 1,000 FUGs collectively manage nearly 2 million hectares of forest. Following this redistribution of power, deforestation rates fell, and local residents were able to earn forest-linked incomes. Previous research shows that families invest part of this forest-related income back into their farms, suggesting a potential pathway toward agricultural modernization. Given these positive results, the Oromia government is now interested in expanding CBFM to the entire region.", "details_inter": "In partnership with the Oromia Forest and Wildlife Enterprise (OFWE), the public agency in charge of managing forests in the Oromia regional state, researchers are testing the impact of CBFM on farming techniques, rural livelihoods, and forest conservation. As part of OFWE’s efforts to expand CBFM across the entire Oromia region in the coming years, researchers are assigning 243 villages in Oromia to one of four different groups: CBFM program with status quo leader selection (500 households): Villages in this group will transition to OFWE’s community-based forestry management system. Leaders of this new FUG will come from a pool of local volunteers, traditionally village elites supported by other village members. CBFM program with anonymized voting for leader selection (500 households): Villages in this group will transition to OFWE’s community-based forestry management system. Residents will select leaders of the new FUG anonymously. CBFM program with a leadership gender quota (500 households): Villages in this group will transition to OFWE’s CBFM system. OFWE will mandate that the vice-chair and at least one other member of the FUGs executive committee be women. Comparison group (1,000 households): Villages in this group will continue to use their traditional, business-as-usual forest management practices, serving as a comparison group. Researchers are conducting three rounds of data collection: baseline (before the intervention starts), midline (approximately eleven months into the intervention), and an endline (2026). At midline, researchers are collecting extensive data on leadership selection mechanisms and their impact on leader quality across multiple dimensions including honesty, level of corruption, social networks, and managerial capability. The endline analysis will examine how the main outcomes, forest-based income of group members and forest conservation, are affected by different leadership selection modalities. The analysis relies on survey data, market data, satellite imagery, experts’ assessments of forest quality, and focus group discussions to elucidate the mechanism linking intervention to impacts. The introduction of alternative leadership selection modalities should improve leadership quality and result in better economic outcomes for group members and more sustainable forest management (Kahsay and Bulte 2021, Kahsay et al. 2023).

Firms and employers struggle to tackle this problem in part because victims may choose not to report abuses due to fear of retaliation or damage to their reputation.

In Bangladesh’s garment industry, harassment is also a persistent issue. Earlier studies suggest that low wages, limited access to legal support, and traditional gender norms give managers considerable power to harass workers. Although people believe harassment to be widespread in this industry, workers rarely report it. Researchers partnered with an anonymous large garment manufacturer in Bangladesh that employed more than 25,000 workers to conduct a phone survey aimed at obtaining more reliable data on workplace harassment. The firm’s senior leaders sought to better understand workers’ experience in the workplace and improve their well-being. The senior leaders also wanted to use this data to inform the firm’s human resources policies. In apparel production, the firm often organizes workers according to line teams. Line teams are likely to be either predominantly women or men, depending on their function – for example, only men typically work in cutting sections, while mostly women work in sewing and finishing. By contrast, more than 90 percent of managers are men.", "details_inter": "Researchers collaborated with the firm’s human resources department to conduct a randomized evaluation on the impact of different survey methods on how workers answered questions about experiencing harassment during work. Using phone surveys, they randomly selected 2,245 workers into 9 groups that each received different combinations of the following techniques aimed at encouraging people to give accurate answers on sensitive topics: Hard garbling (HG): HG is a technique that provides people with plausible deniability in surveys by automatically marking some responses as complaints. The interviewer told workers assigned to this version of the survey that one in five answers asking about harassment would be automatically recorded as \"yes\". This gave people an option to deny reporting issues and made it safer for people to report without worrying about being blamed later. Rapport building (RB): In this version of the survey, the interviewer spent time chatting with the worker about life outside of work to create a sense of trust and emotional connection. The aim was to help workers feel at ease to answer sensitive questions. Low personally identifiable information (Low PII): In this version, interviewers did not ask workers about information that someone who saw the survey could use to identify the worker. In particular, interviewers did not ask workers the name of their direct supervisor or which production team they worked on. Comparison group: In this version, workers received a business-as-usual survey—interviewers asked questions about harassment directly, did not apply extra effort to build trust, and gathered personally identifying information. Interviewers asked workers about workers’ experience with three types of harassment in the past year—physical harassment, sexual harassment, and threatening behavior—by their direct supervisor. They also posed questions on worker well-being like mental health and job satisfaction. The researchers were also interested in how improved reporting data could be used to answer policy-relevant questions about the nature of harassment in the firm, such as: How prevalent is harassment? What share of employees are responsible for the damage? How isolated are victims within teams? All respondents were assured of a strong commitment to confidentiality as part of the process for consenting to participate in the study. To design the survey questions for the context, the research team conducted focus group discussions, interviews, and pilot surveys with garment workers before the main surveys.", "results_lessons": "Making it safer for workers to report if they experienced harassment by using the hard garbling (HG) method, which automatically records a subset of cases as harassment, gave workers an option to deny having reported. This increased the estimated rate of harassment reports from both women and men, and across different types of workplace harassment. Harassment reporting: In the comparison group using the business-as-usual survey method, 9.9 percent of workers reported experiencing threatening behavior, 1.53 percent reported physical harassment, and 1.78 percent reported being sexually harassed by their supervisor. When interviewers used the HG survey method, workers were 4.5 percentage points more likely to report threatening behavior, 4.4 percentage points more likely to report physical harassment, and 4.8 percentage points more likely to report sexual harassment. Both women and men reported more experiences of harassment, although the effect was larger among men. Researchers found that the other survey tactics of building rapport with workers or removing identifying information did not have clear effects on helping workers report more cases across all different types of harassment. Harassment statistics for informing policy decisions: To help the anonymous firm use data to answer policy-relevant questions, researchers used the results of the HG surveys to more accurately estimate the nature of harassment in these factories. They measured how common harassment was, how many managers were involved, and whether a single manager was more likely to harass one or several team members. Using the new survey data, researchers estimated that 13.5 percent of workers experienced threatening behavior, 5.7 percent physical harassment, and 7.7 percent sexual harassment by their managers. At the team level (there were seven workers per production team on average), harassment is widespread: 72 percent of teams had at least one worker experiencing threatening behavior, 40 percent had at least one who had suffered sexual harassment, and 25 percent had at least one who had been subject to physical harassment. However, victims were often the only person on their team to experience (or report) the harassment. Overall, the research showed that workers were more likely to report sensitive harassment experiences when the interview method allowed them to deny that they had reported harassment. The findings also showed that harassment in this context was widespread, that many managers were responsible, and that victims were often isolated. The researchers used the results to inform the senior management of the firm about the extent and nature of harassment in the firm, suggesting viable policy options to address the problem. Researchers suggested that for this firm, a policy of firing all offending managers would be very costly, and the firm may find it less costly to focus on changing the behavior of existing managers and changes in company norms.", "citations": "", "run_id": "2026-02-24 182618", "scraped_at": "2026-02-24T18:30:52", "hash": "b02d4811d662df152bf994b46a0cb169e8e15186ed50db8158d8baa52f121b6b"}

The results suggest that a US$1,000 monthly cash transfer for three years might not be sufficient to address the health care challenges of people with low incomes. While there were some improvements and changes in the health outcomes of the participants, as a policy tool, unconditional cash transfers alone might not be targeted enough to improve the health outcomes of people with low incomes.", "citations": "Miller, Sarah, Elizabeth Rhodes, Alexander W.

Although home upgrade programs offer improvements that are often cost-effective, actual savings often fall short of projections. Researchers conducted a randomized evaluation of the Illinois Home Weatherization Assistance Program (IHWAP), which aims to improve energy efficiency in low-income households. The study tested the impact of performance-based pay for contractors implementing air sealing retrofits as part of IHWAP. Contractors were randomly assigned to receive either no bonus, a low bonus (US$0.40), or a high bonus (US$1.00) per unit of air sealing beyond the target. The introduction of performance bonuses led to increased air-tightness in homes, reduced the likelihood of contractors being called back due to deficiencies, and resulted in overall reductions in household energy use.", "policy_issue": "The building sector accounts for 30 percent of annual greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, due largely to inefficient and leaky buildings that require energy-intensive heating and cooling systems. To address this, many organizations invest in large-scale energy efficiency upgrades and retrofits for existing buildings. Air sealing—the identification and sealing of air leakage sites, including those in attics, walls, basements, and/or crawl spaces—is one key strategy. The United States has addressed this issue through federally funded programs like the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP), which aims to mitigate climate change and reduce energy costs for low-income households by enhancing energy efficiency. In Illinois, this initiative operates as the Illinois Home Weatherization Assistance Program (IHWAP), which focuses on improvements such as air sealing. Previous research has found that home upgrade programs often deliver less savings than expected, with contractor underperformance and modeling bias identified as drivers of these differences. While enforcing minimum quality standards might improve workmanship, some stakeholders believe that offering performance-based pay may facilitate a more efficient allocation of contractor effort. Yet, there is limited evidence on how these incentives influence contractors’ work, especially for air sealing retrofits. This study investigated whether performance-based pay can meaningfully enhance energy savings and overall program outcomes.", "context_of_eval": "The WAP is the largest US residential weatherization program, annually reducing energy costs for approximately 35,000 low-income households by increasing home energy efficiency.1 Illinois, along with four other states, accounts for roughly one-third of the program funding, which is allocated based on factors such as weather conditions and the size of the low-income population. The IHWAP operates through roughly 33 agencies that serve the state’s 106 counties. Air sealing is among the four major energy-saving retrofits that these agencies perform—wall insulation, attic insulation, and furnace replacements comprising the remainder—and is especially important for homes older than 20 years, which tend to be leakier. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, approved in late 2021, allocated US$3.5 billion to expand the WAP. This additional funding presented a timely opportunity to improve the cost effectiveness and energy efficiency of air sealing upgrades. Within the IHWAP, all counties outside of Cook County utilized fixed payments for air sealing that were based on the initial leakage level, providing the opportunity to evaluate the impact of performance-based payments for contractors in these areas. Researchers hypothesized that offering bonuses to contractors based on the reductions of leakiness of the house after air sealing would incentivize higher quality work and further reduce emissions.", "details_inter": "Researchers conducted a randomized evaluation to test the impact of piece-rate incentives for contractors, utilizing both low and high incentive payments to understand how contractors respond to different rates. The primary outcomes of interest were air sealing effectiveness, measured by using blower door tests—which assess how leaky a house is—and energy savings, determined through utility bill data. The study used job-level randomization, assigning 1,698 contracts to one of three groups. This approach allowed individual contractors to work across any of the treatment groups, facilitating a thorough comparison of strategies: High payment group: Jobs assigned to this treatment group included an offer of US$1.00 per unit of air sealing achieved beyond the target. Low payment group: Jobs assigned to this treatment group included an offer of US$0.40 per unit of air sealing achieved beyond the target. Comparison group: Jobs assigned to this treatment group did not include a bonus offer beyond the usual fixed payment. Between 2018 and 2019, jobs were randomly assigned to one of three groups using the same software that assigned work orders to contractors in the IHWAP. Contractors performed the air sealing work in eligible homes as part of the regular weatherization process. Contracts for jobs in the high payment and low payment groups explicitly highlighted the performance-based incentive assigned to the job. Researchers used comprehensive administrative data, inspection reports completed by quality control inspectors, and monthly gas and electric billing data to estimate the effect of the intervention. The evaluation measured three outcomes: homes' air-tightness, likelihood of contractors being called back by inspectors to fix deficiencies, and household energy use. To measure home’s air-tightness, or how well a building prevents air leakage, blower door tests, the standard practice in the industry, were used. Blower door tests involve placing a large fan at the entrance of a home to pull air out of the house, creating a pressure difference. The amount of air needed to maintain this pressure, measured in CFM50 (cubic feet per minute at 50 Pascals), indicates how tightly sealed the home is.", "results_lessons": "Performance-based incentives for the IHWAP contractors improved the effectiveness of air sealing retrofits, reduced the likelihood of contractors being called back due to deficiencies, and resulted in overall reductions in household energy use. Air Sealing Effectiveness and Callbacks: The bonus payment regime—including both high and low incentive payments—resulted in an average reduction of 89 CFM50 beyond the 1563 CFM50 reduction achieved by contractors with fixed payments (a 5.7 percent increase in air-tightness). Additionally, performance incentives, whether high or low bonus payments, reduced the probability of inspectors calling back contractors to fix deficiencies by 2.95 percentage points relative to a baseline callback rate of 7.8 percent for contractors with fixed payments (a 37 percent decrease). Researchers found no significant difference between the high and low payment treatments on callbacks or air sealing effectiveness. Energy Savings: Jobs that were randomly assigned to performance-based bonuses, whether high or low, led to reductions in household energy use. These homes decreased their gas consumption by an average of 0.28-0.38 MMBtu (million British thermal units) beyond the 1.58-1.62 MMBtu reduction achieved in jobs with fixed payments—a 5.5 percent decrease. Assignment to a high-payment or low-payment job did not lead to lower-quality performance in subsequent fixed payment retrofits, suggesting that contractors maintained quality across all assigned jobs. Moreover, contractors who previously performed high-quality jobs responded more strongly to the incentives. Cost Effectiveness: Researchers estimated the program’s cost-effectiveness by examining both its private (which is the metric relevant for WAP) and social benefits and evaluating how efficiently government spending translated into public gains. They found that while the high payment incentives led to slightly larger benefits per home, the low payment incentives proved to be more cost-effective. The results suggest that it may be more cost-effective to distribute smaller bonuses across a larger number of contracts rather than providing large bonuses to fewer contracts. Overall, the findings in this paper suggest that performance-based pay for weatherization services has the potential to reduce household energy consumption. Air sealing can also be a key strategy in abating household greenhouse gas emissions and contractor incentives, structured like the ones in this evaluation, can offer a cost-effective solution to providing increased air sealing to leaky homes.", "citations": "https://www.nber.org/papers/w31322", "run_id": "2026-02-24 182618", "scraped_at": "2026-02-24T18:30:52", "hash": "7572104f640b34de032dcd94b03cfb46a9c88e258fcbe5e3a2b7ac320901e243"}

Climate change is exacerbating water scarcity, putting billions at greater risk of waterborne diseases. At the same time, existing strategies to improve water access are proving insufficient. Piped water systems, while effective in high-income countries, are prohibitively expensive to implement and maintain in rural areas of low-income countries. Evaluations of point-of-use chlorine treatments have demonstrated their affordability and effectiveness at reducing health risks, but few people adopt them for regular use even when a chlorine solution is offered for free.", "context_of_eval": "The evaluation took place in rural Odisha, India, one of the country’s lowest-income states, where 26 percent of rural households do not have access to clean water. Most households depend on groundwater or surface water, which is often contaminated and needs to be boiled or treated with chlorine to make it safe for drinking. Prior to the evaluation, researchers collected seventeen water samples and detected E. Coli and fecal bacteria in all of them. Households also spend substantial time retrieving water. On average, households in the area of study spent about 32 minutes a day collecting drinking water at baseline. On average, households in a representative group spent INR 12,494 (US$156.18) at the time of study in monthly expenses and spent INR 9,000 (US$112.50) each month. The average household comprised five members, including three children. Households had little savings, with a median bank balance of INR 2,000 (US$25).

Water was treated at local, village-based facilities to remove biological contaminants. Home delivery ensured households received clean water without the time costs and contamination risks associated with collection and transport. Rural households were randomly assigned to one of four groups: 1. Priced water group (40 villages): Households in these villages could purchase water for a price. Within each village, researchers further randomized thirteen households to receive a ten percent discount on the price of purchased water, thirteen households to receive a fifty percent discount, and thirteen households to receive a ninety percent discount. The remaining households in the villages of this group purchased the water for full market price. 2. Free water group (40 villages): In each village of this group, 39 households were randomly selected to receive a free ration of 400 liters of water per month. Selected households had to place an order with Spring Health to receive the water and could thus opt out of receiving rations by not placing orders. Selected households who used up their ration and households not selected to receive free water rations could both order water at the full market price. 3. Exchangeable entitlements group (40 villages): In each village of this group, 38 households were randomly selected to receive an entitlement for 400 liters of free water per month, similar to selected households in the free water group. However, selected households in this group could exchange any unclaimed water within their entitlement for cash. The amount of cash was set equal to one of the prices that households in the priced water group paid, also randomly assigned. Refunds for each household in this group were calculated and disbursed at the end of each month, based on any unclaimed water. 4. Comparison group (40 villages): In this group, villages experienced no changes to their pre-existing water access conditions and did not participate in the intervention. Households in these villages could still purchase water through Spring Health at full market price but received no special offers. In addition to the groups described above, researchers randomly selected five households from each non-comparison group village to receive a one-time free water ration of 100 liters to test whether experience with clean water impacted subsequent demand. The study took place between May 2022 and August 2023 and included 60,000 households across 160 villages. Researchers used scratch cards to implement household-level randomization. Each household received a card revealing their assigned program (e.g., discount level or entitlement amount). To measure outcomes, researchers used administrative data on water orders from Spring Health and collected data through surveys of households.", "results_lessons": "Take-up of low-cost, clean water—as measured by how much water households ordered—was high. Households also valued home-delivered clean water highly. Take-up: Households in the free water group increased their water consumption by an average of 270 liters per month. Similarly, households in the exchangeable entitlements group increased their consumption by 291 liters per month, utilizing a portion of the 400 liters of water they were entitled to under the study. In the priced water group, households purchased low amounts at high prices, but take-up rose as prices dropped. The likelihood of a household ordering water under the free ration program was 90 percent. Household valuation of home-delivered clean water: From the variation across different price points in the priced water group, households’ willingness to pay for clean water at home was INR 132 per month (US$1.65). From the exchangeable entitlements group, households were willing to forego INR 420 per month (US$5.25) to ensure they have enough drinking water for the month. Both of these figures indicate that households are willing to exchange large amounts of their money for access to clean water at home, or in other words, place a high value on clean water. Water collection and purification: Households in the three intervention groups spent 15-39 percent less time collecting water, relative to the 32 minutes that households in the comparison group spent retrieving water on average. Additionally, clean water delivery reduced the need for boiling water, which takes both time to collect the fuel and money to pay for it. Health outcomes: Households which were offered the priced water intervention had 22 percent fewer instances of sickness relative to the comparison group. This effect took place primarily among households with small children. When considering only households that report actually drinking clean water in surveys, households in the priced water and exchangeable entitlements groups missed 62 percent and 36 percent fewer days of work, respectively. For the free water group, it is not certain whether any health impacts were due to chance or not. Overall, delivering treated water directly to households had high take-up, especially compared to point-of-use chlorine treatments which often resulted in poorer tasting water. Households value access to clean water at home highly, and researchers note that this value may be high enough to sustain the profitability of privately providing water.", "citations": "Burling, Fiona, Amir Jina, and Anant Sudarshan. “The Value of Clean Water: Experimental Evidence from Rural India.” Working Paper, September 2024.", "run_id": "2026-02-24 182618", "scraped_at": "2026-02-24T18:30:52", "hash": "0b402f79ec80388b68168864ed64dd826b8d2f85e0c4602ae98c69fa7bbe79f8"}

However, teacher turnover remains a significant challenge, with 20 percent of teachers leaving their jobs annually. Turnover is especially high in schools with low learning levels 2. Unlike many low- and middle-income countries, Rwanda does not offer a wage premium for public sector teaching jobs, leading many qualified individuals to pursue other opportunities instead. In 2017, only 37 percent of graduates from teacher training colleges (TTC) were employed as teachers, while 15 percent held salaried, non-teaching jobs. This was not due to a lack of teaching positions, as nearly a quarter of vacancies created by teacher turnover remained unfilled in the following school year. Instead, it was more likely because TTC graduates could earn a wage premium of nearly 30 percent in non-teaching sectors. Given these challenges, recruiting and retaining qualified, skilled, and motivated teachers to improve education quality remains a priority for the Government of Rwanda.", "details_inter": "Researchers conducted a randomized evaluation to test the impact of pay for performance (P4P) contracts on teacher characteristics, teacher effort, and student learning. During the recruitment process of public-school teachers in 2016, potential applicants were randomly assigned to see job advertisements for either fixed wage or P4P contracts for teaching jobs. After recruitment, a second randomization occurred at the school level, determining whether schools would offer fixed wage or P4P contracts. Schools were randomized into one of the two groups. P4P contracts group (85 schools): The P4P contract, developed in collaboration with the Rwanda Education Board and Ministry of Education, awarded a bonus of RWF 100,000 (USD 127.02 in 2016) to the top 20 percent of teachers, assessed by a metric that equally weighted student learning outcomes and teacher inputs. The bonus was equal to about fifteen percent of the average salary. Comparison group (79 schools): The fixed wage contract paid every teacher an extra RWF 20,000 (USD 25.4 in 2016) in addition to their base salary.

However, pay-for-performance contracts did not attract teachers with different motivations or skills compared to those paid in fixed wage contracts. Teacher characteristics: There was no meaningful difference in the quality of teachers who applied to P4P contracts compared to those who applied to fixed wage contracts, as measured by their teacher training college exam scores. However, teachers who saw and were hired under P4P contracts were slightly less intrinsically motivated than teachers who saw and were hired under fixed contracts. Teacher effort: Teacher presence was measured as the fraction of days a teacher was present during spot checks. P4P teachers were present 97 percent of the time, which was 8 percentage points (or 9 percent) higher than fixed wage teachers, who were present 89 percent of the time. P4P teachers also scored 0.10 points (5 percent) higher on a four point pedagogical performance rubric compared to fixed wage teachers who scored 1.98.

In 2018, 47.7 percent of Bissau-Guineans were experiencing poverty; among them, 75 percent lived in rural areas.1 The study focused on rural villages in the Quinara and Tombali regions, which have some of the lowest learning levels in the country. The selected villages were relatively small and isolated, with rough terrain, large distances between locations, and no internet connection during the period of the study. The official education system in Guinea Bissau comprises nine years of compulsory basic education, followed by three years of secondary school.

At the beginning of the study, half of the schools in the area were run by the government. The rest were managed by local communities, NGOs, or private organizations. Despite schools being open, learning levels remained extremely low. In 2010, seventy percent of children in a nationally representative survey were enrolled in school, but only a third of the children surveyed could identify a numeral or read a simple word.

The intervention team recruited, trained, and monitored teachers to deliver schooling from the pre-primary level to grade 3. They implemented a specially designed curriculum, teacher training materials (e.g. scripted lessons), and materials for both teachers and students. The program entailed frequent monitoring of teachers with a focus on improving teaching practices (i.e., teacher coaching) and assessing children as well as regular efforts to stimulate and sustain community involvement. Each community provided and furnished the spaces in which schooling took place. The evaluation included 49 villages, with a total of 2,112 eligible children. Villages were randomly assigned to either the intervention or comparison group. Intervention group (16 villages): Children in villages randomly selected to receive the intervention received four years of school in place of government schooling, starting with a year of pre-primary school focusing on Portuguese language acquisition, followed by grades 1-3 of the national primary education curriculum. Comparison group (33 villages): Children in the comparison group had access to local government, community, and private schools. All children were taught in Portuguese, the official language in Guinea Bissau. Researchers conducted surveys before, during, and after the intervention to track enrollment, attendance, residence, and sibling literacy and numeracy. After completing four years of schooling, students took one-on-one oral early grade reading and math assessments (EGRA and EGMA) which were used to measure the intervention’s impact on their reading and math skills. The main ethical consideration the researchers faced was whether it was ethical to randomly assign such a highly-resourced intervention. They felt that this was justified because a similarly highly-resourced intervention in health that they had previously run had no impact on the outcome of interest, so they were sufficiently unsure as to the ultimate impact of the intervention to justify randomization. In addition, they agreed to (and did, upon analysis of the results) provide the intervention to all villages in the study, regardless of randomization status, for several years after the intervention if a positive impact was found.", "results_lessons": "Children in the intervention group showed clear gains over children in the comparison group on the endline assessment. Using each child’s composite scores as a measure, children in intervention villages got 70.5 percent of questions right on average, while children in comparison villages got 11.2 percent of questions correct (a difference of 59.3 percentage points or 529 percent). In terms of test score standard deviations, this amounted to 5.3 SDs. Literacy and numeracy: Children in intervention villages were also much more likely to reach international standards of foundational literacy and numeracy than those in the comparison villages. On the endline test, 63.9 percent of children in intervention villages met the standard for numeracy. In comparison villages, less than 0.1 percent of children reached the same threshold. For numeracy, 21.3 percent of intervention children met the standard for numeracy, and not a single child in the comparison villages reached this standard. Reading: Children in the intervention group scored 65.7 percentage points better on endline reading tests than children in the comparison group, who answered 6.8 percent of questions correctly. This comprised a 966 percent difference. Across all reading skills tested, ranging from naming letters to demonstrating comprehension, students in the intervention group outperformed comparison children by at least 42 percentage points. For example, letter recognition among children in treatment villages was 56.8 percentage points better than in the comparison villages (where the average was 11.5 percent of questions answered correctly; a 494 percent difference). Their o ral reading fluency was 82.6 percentage points higher (compared to a comparison group average of 4.3 percent; a 1,921 percent difference) , and their reading comprehension was 74.6 percentage points higher (from a comparison village average of 5.1 percent; a 1,463 percent difference). By the end of the intervention, all children in the intervention group could recognize at least one letter, compared to only 64.8 percent of children in the comparison group (a 54 percent difference). Math: Children in intervention villages scored 52.9 percentage points better on endline math tests compared to children in the comparison villages (the average rate for comparison children was 15.6 percent of questions answered correctly; this comprises a 339 percent difference). The difference in performance between children in intervention and comparison villages across the various math skills assessed ranged from 32 to 69.8 percentage points depending on the skill, with the largest differences made in quantitative comparison skills (from a comparison group average of 19.9 percent; a 351 percent difference) . The skills tested on the math assessment spanned in difficulty from identifying numbers to solving word problems. The enrolled children could answer around 12 more single-digit addition problems (out of 20 total), as compared to a comparison group average of approximately 3 (a 441 percent difference) and around 8 more single-digit subtraction problems from a comparison group average of about 1 (a 638 percent difference). By the end of the intervention, all children in the intervention group could name at least one number, as compared to 84.5 percent of children in the comparison group (an 18 percent difference). Enrollment and progression: Four years into the study, children in the intervention villages were 12 percentage points more likely to be enrolled in school compared to 85 percent of children in comparison villages (a 14.12 percent difference) . They were also 65.6 percentage points more likely to be enrolled in the second grade or higher. Overall, the study found evidence that concerted provision of early primary education in communities where government-provided schooling is inconsistent can substantially increase children’s foundational literacy and numeracy and school attendance to levels comparable to those in far higher-income countries. Although the intervention required many resources, costing approximately US$425 per child per year, estimates of the future benefits to the child’s future employment and income far exceed the program’s costs. Use of Results Due to the large learning gains, the intervention was extended to children entering school in all 49 villages initially included in the randomized evaluation, whether they were assigned to the intervention or comparison group. The intervention was also offered to a new cohort of children aged 5-6 (i.e. at pre-school age). These children were enrolled in 2019, received one year of pre-primary, and continued to receive schooling until at least Grade 4 (an extension of the coverage of the original intervention). In addition to extending the intervention to all villages that were part of the evaluation, the researchers will continue collecting data on the participating children into their adolescence, with the goal of understanding the extent to which the learning gains measured in the initial evaluation persist later in life and the potential impacts on school success and persistence. They will also measure the impacts of the intervention on families and communities.", "citations": "Fazzio, Ila, Alex Eble, Robin L.

For example, community-based health workers (CHWs) are regularly hired to provide health services in rural areas, often acquiring their skills on the job. Monitoring these frontline workers, who vary in experience levels and are spread across large areas, can take up much of supervisors’ capacity or reduce monitoring. Low levels of monitoring can result in insufficient effort and absenteeism among CHWs, given limited training and advising from their supervisors. However, in resource-constrained settings, hiring additional supervisors to sufficiently monitor frontline workers may not be feasible or may require hiring fewer frontline workers due to budget constraints. Remote monitoring technology (e-monitoring) may improve supervision and free up time for supervisors to complete other activities, like training CHWs. More evidence is needed to understand the impact of e-monitoring or changing the ratio of supervisors to frontline workers on the performance of supervisors and on service delivery.", "context_of_eval": "Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Health and Sanitation established a Community Health Worker Program in 2017 to provide hard-to-reach areas with basic health services, including pre- and post-natal care for mothers and early childhood care.

Evidence shows that microfinance has had limited effects on business outcomes on average. While some research has highlighted high returns to capital for men, the returns to capital for women in low- and middle-income countries remain small. One potential reason for this disparity is that women often face pressure to share resources.

Can changing the form of microfinance loan disbursement from cash to a digital account improve women’s business performance?", "context_of_eval": "This study took place in Kampala, Uganda, a city where both mobile money use and microfinance borrowing are common. In Uganda, 51 percent of the population used mobile money services in 2017, with higher usage rates among women in Kampala.

The study involved 3,000 female microentrepreneurs who had applied and were already approved to get loans from BRAC. The average size of the loan was US$380. Women were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Mobile Account: (993 participants) Women in this group were offered a new SIM card and a mobile money account described as being for their business. If they accepted the offer, they received one-on-one support to open a mobile money account, and information on how to use the mobile account and its features. They received their microfinance loan as cash. Mobile Disbursement: (982 participants) Women in this group received their microfinance loans through their mobile money accounts.

The effects were most pronounced for women who faced pressure to share their loan money with other household members. Business Outcomes: Women who received their loan via the mobile money account saw an 11 percent increase in business capital (US$70) and a 15 percent increase in business profits (US$18) on average in contrast to the comparison group. In contrast, women who were offered a mobile money account but received their loan as cash did not see a change in business outcomes compared to the comparison group. Women who received their loan via the mobile money account held significant balances on the account immediately after the loan was disbursed and drew down the loan over a three-month period, using the account to store the loan safely. The positive business impacts for women who received their loan through the mobile account were driven by women who experienced the most pressure to share money with family members. These women saw a 26 percent increase in business capital (US$180) and a 25 percent increase in business profits (US$30) compared to the comparison group. The sharing pressure appeared to come primarily from spouses. Married women who lived with their spouse and who ran more profitable businesses benefited the most from receiving their loans via their mobile accounts. These women who got their loan the via mobile account gave less money to their spouses each month. The mobile money account provided a private way to store the loan, reducing the visibility of the money and the pressure to share it. Household Income and Consumption: The mobile disbursement method increased total household income by US$24 on average, a 7 percent increase from the comparison group. Women in this group also had higher household consumption, and reported spending more on food and schooling, categories that typically align with women’s spending preferences. Account Usage: When women received a mobile account but got their loan via cash, they did not deposit their loan into the mobile money account themselves. Researchers suggest this may be because women defaulted to keeping the loan in the form in which they initially received it. Women who received their loan via the mobile account were more likely to report wanting to receive subsequent loans on a mobile money account, but this preference did not translate into them depositing more of their own money into this account. Loan Usage: Women who received their loan through the mobile account spent less of their loan on household items and more on their businesses. They saved more of the loan on the mobile money account, which was earmarked for their business. The study suggests that disbursing microfinance loans onto digital accounts can help female entrepreneurs overcome pressure to share money with family members and improve their business performance.

Researchers conducted a randomized evaluation to test the impact of providing information about police alternatives on individuals' reported likelihood of calling the police and a follow-up randomized evaluation to understand key public-safety stakeholders’ receptiveness of police alternatives. The first study found that information about police alternatives had a bipartisan decrease on police reliance in nonviolent scenarios. The second study revealed that police are more responsive to evidence on public interest in police alternatives when it is presented using some framing devices compared to others. Qualitative interviews shed additional light on the mechanisms underlying these effects.", "policy_issue": "Police officers are often called upon to respond to nonviolent incidents that other professionals may be well suited to handle. Many governmental and nongovernmental resources exist as alternatives to police for nonviolent scenarios. Some examples include hotlines for suicide prevention and mental health emergencies; social services such as housing aid, nutrition programs, and employment support; and other community-based resources offering support for youth, LGBTQ+ individuals, people experiencing homelessness, domestic violence, and substance use disorder. Proponents of these alternatives believe they may help improve community safety while reducing police violence, which has increased in recent years across the United States.1 In 2023, over 1,200 people were killed by police.2 Over half of these deaths occurred after police responded to suspected nonviolent offenses or in cases where no crime was reported, such as someone experiencing a mental health crisis.3 This violence disproportionately affects people of color—particularly young men of color4—and other groups such as those experiencing poverty5 or homelessness.6 In the wake of high-profile incidents of police violence in the United States, there has been a growing call to explore alternatives to traditional policing. However, the scale of policing has not reduced as a result of recent anti-police violence movements. It is not clear whether this trend is due to a lack of demand for police alternatives or a lack of information about such alternatives among the general US population. It is also unclear if the police force is supportive of shifting towards alternative crisis responders for nonviolent scenarios. The study seeks to answer whether providing information about police alternatives impacts public reliance on police, particularly in nonviolent situations and if police and other stakeholders are open to these alternatives.", "context_of_eval": "To answer these questions, researchers conducted a series of randomized evaluations. In the first study, researchers used an online survey platform in the United States, Prolific, to recruit participants in July and August 2024. Survey respondents were 60 percent white, less than half identified as men, and the average age was 47. A majority of participants self-identified as Democrats. After randomization, the three groups were balanced on age, race, gender, political affiliation, marital status, and a baseline value on an index for policing demand. The study participants were fairly representative of the United States population when compared to demographics from the American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, but skewed slightly older, more educated, more Democratic, and had a higher proportion of Black people. In the second study, conducted from February to March 2024, researchers gathered contact information for relevant stakeholders using data from the National Public Safety Information Bureau, public Department of Justice records, and local official contacts from an online resource. They sought out police officers and sheriffs, local officials, DOJ grantees, and other law enforcement. The final sample included 45,163 valid email addresses. The main analysis included the 11,623 recipients who opened the email, across 2,368 US counties.", "details_inter": "Study One: Survey Researchers evaluated the impact of providing information about police alternatives on individuals' reported likelihood of calling the police. In August 2024, researchers recruited 2,745 adults in the United States to participate in the evaluation. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups. Comparison Group: Participants in this group received a placebo video providing information on economic indicators (e.g., full-time and part-time employment rates). Government Group: Participants in this group received a video providing information on government resources that can serve as alternatives to police response, including the 988 Suicide Prevention Hotline, the 211 Community Assistance Hotline, and the 311 City Services Hotline. Don’t Call the Police (DCTP) Group: Participants in this group received a video highlighting how police are often the default responders to emergencies in the United States, even for calls not involving violent crimes. The video then presented information on nongovernmental emergency response options through dontcallthepolice.com, a database of community resources suitable for attending to nonviolent crises. The video also included information on the 988, 211, and 311 hotlines from the Government video. Participants were presented with five scenarios and asked to rate their likelihood of calling the police for assistance in each case. The scenarios included both violent incidents (e.g., armed robbery) and nonviolent situations (e.g., a naked man walking down the street). Scenarios were presented to respondents in a randomized order. The evaluation measured participants' self-reported inclination to call the police and their demand for alternative first responders. Researchers conducted a follow-up survey with study participants a week after the initial survey to assess the persistence of the effects on awareness of the 988 helpline. Study Two: Stakeholder Outreach The second part of the evaluation aimed to estimate receptiveness among key stakeholders who shape policies to promote public safety (e.g., police officers, sheriffs). The researchers conducted a field experiment disseminating a summary of a previous version of the survey experiment (the results of which are similar to those in this evaluation) to a sample of these stakeholders. Counties were randomized into two conditions with different email subject lines: 911 Subject line: “New research: bipartisan support for police alternatives - receive information about the findings and 911alternatives.com” DCTP Subject line: “New research: bipartisan support for police alternatives - receive information about the findings and dontcallthepolice.com” The content of the email was the same for both groups; it informed recipients that providing the public with information about resources available on dontcallthepolice.com reduced the likelihood of calling the police for nonviolent encounters. Stakeholders could request more information on the study and provide feedback on the report. The researchers also conducted qualitative interviews with sixty participants to deepen their understanding of the findings.", "results_lessons": "The first study found that providing information about police alternatives significantly reduced the likelihood of relying on police in nonviolent scenarios. Participants who received information about the 988 Suicide and Crisis line were more likely to use the hotline in a hypothetical suicidal ideation scenario a week later. In the second study, police officers—but not other stakeholders—engaged with the DCTP email at higher rates than the 911 email. Study One: Survey Demand for Police in Violent Scenarios There was no meaningful impact of the DCTP or Government interventions on police reliance in the armed robbery scenario presented. The comparison group mean for this scenario was 93 percent, suggesting that individuals may already recognize the important role of police intervention in high-stakes, violent situations. In the other violent scenario presented, where a woman is screaming and crying while a man makes threats, the DCTP group was 5.5 percentage points less likely to say that they would call the police (a 7 percent decrease from a baseline of 80.7). In contrast, the Government group was 1.8 percentage points more likely to say they would call the police in the same scenario (a 2 percent increase from a baseline of 80.7). Demand for Police in Nonviolent Scenarios Participants in the DCTP group were 2.6–17 percentage points less likely than the comparison group to call the police in nonviolent situations ranging from a scenario where someone is disruptively asking for money (a 10 percent decrease from a baseline of 24.7) to suicidal ideation (a 33 percent decrease from a baseline of 51.8). In contrast, participants in the Government group were 3.1 percentage points more likely to say they would call the police in a scenario where someone is disruptively asking for money (a 12 percent increase from a baseline of 24.7). In the other nonviolent scenarios presented, participants in the Government group were just as likely to call the police as those in the comparison group. Preferences for First Responders The study also examined participants' preferences for who should respond in each scenario: the police, a social worker, or no one. The DCTP group demonstrated reduced preference for police response in all but the armed robbery scenario. Preference for police as first responders decreased by 4.75–12 percentage points (ranging from 8–39 percent decreases from respective baselines) across the remaining four scenarios. Researchers found a corresponding increase in preference for a social worker as the first responder. The DCTP group increased their preference for a social worker by 4.71–14.6 percentage points (ranging from 6–67 percent increases from respective baselines) across the remaining four scenarios. The Government group did not demonstrate different preferences for first responders relative to the comparison group in any scenario. Follow-up Survey: Impact on Recall of Police Alternatives One week after the initial intervention, a follow-up survey assessed participants' recall of the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. The follow-up survey asked participants to choose a hotline to call within 20 seconds of being faced with a hypothetical suicidal ideation scenario. Over 85 percent of the initial study participants engaged in the follow-up survey (2,342 respondents). Participants in the DCTP group were 8 percentage points more likely to remember the 988 hotline relative to the comparison group who did not receive such information (an 89 percent increase over the comparison group mean of 9 percent). Participants in the Government group, who also received information about the 988 hotline, were 9 percentage points more likely than the comparison group to recall the hotline information (a 100 percent increase over the comparison group mean of 9 percent). Study Two: Stakeholder Outreach Non-police recipients did not respond or engage at meaningfully different rates to the two emails while police recipients engaged more with the DCTP email than with the 911 email. Compared to study participants who are not police and received the 911 subject line, police who received the DCTP subject line were 3 percentage points more likely to request additional information on the study (a 61 percent increase relative to a comparison mean of 5). The authors hypothesize that the differential response by subject line reveals police resistance to specific framings of alternative responders that would symbolically or substantively challenge the role of police in US public safety. Qualitative follow-up interviews revealed support for this theory. The first study demonstrated that providing information about police alternatives can meaningfully reduce the demand for police in nonviolent situations while maintaining or even increasing the demand for police in violent scenarios across political affiliations. The impact on recall of the 988 hotline further underscores the effectiveness of targeted educational interventions in promoting the use of alternative crisis resources. The second study demonstrated the importance of generating buy-in from key stakeholders, such as police themselves, and found that specific framing devices may be helpful for engaging these audiences.", "citations": "Ba, Bocar A., Meghna Baskar, Tony Cheng and Rei Mariman. 2024. \"Understanding Demand for Police Alternatives.\" NBER Working Paper #32418, August 2024", "run_id": "2026-02-24 182618", "scraped_at": "2026-02-24T18:30:52", "hash": "45c7d12bb9d7795e0f98dc71f6c922c87bc27b1e717c1e4ca077880b9971aa90"}

Researchers conducted a randomized evaluation on the impact of the unconditional cash transfer on health care utilization and a variety of health outcomes. Those who received the cash transfer had fewer emergency department visits, including those related to behavioral health or substance use, fewer admissions to the hospital from the emergency department, and more outpatient visits to subspecialists than those who did not receive the cash transfer. There were no significant differences in visits to primary care, Covid-19 vaccination, or biomarker measures of health.", "policy_issue": "In the United States, people with low incomes experience worse health than their higher income counterparts. Immigrant communities can face additional disparities in employment, income, and access to social safety net programming.12 The Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent employment and income shocks exacerbated these disparities.3 Many social safety net programs that helped buffer people from food and financial insecurity during the pandemic—including unemployment insurance, stimulus checks, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)—were unavailable to undocumented immigrants due to eligibility restrictions. Income support through cash transfers may improve health outcomes and reduce financial strain, particularly among populations that do not have access to the full set of social safety net resources. A common claim about cash transfers, especially unconditional ones, is that they can increase substance use, thereby decreasing health outcomes. Previous studies of other populations in the United States have found mixed results on the impact cash transfers have on health outcomes. Can unconditional cash transfers improve health outcomes for a low-income, majority Latino/a and immigrant population?", "context_of_eval": "The City of Chelsea was disproportionately affected by Covid-19; by the end of 2020, the city had the highest cumulative incidence rate in Massachusetts. The city’s workforce was also concentrated in sectors that were shut down due to the pandemic (e.g., service industries and factories),4 and many in the community’s large immigrant population were not eligible for unemployment insurance or stimulus checks. To address the growing rates of food insecurity in Chelsea, the city ran a financial support program for residents called Chelsea Eats. The program distributed debit cards with up to US$400 dollars given each month to eligible individuals via a lottery. The cash amount depended on an individual’s household size: a household of one, two, or more than three people would receive US$200, US$300, or US$400 respectively. Residents were eligible to apply for the program if they resided in Chelsea and their family income was below thirty percent of the Boston area median income. The cards could be used anywhere that accepted Visa. The program ran from November 2020 to July 2021.", "details_inter": "Because applications outnumbered the capacity of the program, the program used a lottery to randomly select who would receive the funds. Only one person per family was permitted to enter the lottery, but they could receive additional lottery tickets if they met specific criteria: they had a child, they had an older adult in the family, they were a veteran or disabled, no one was working in the family, they were ineligible for food assistance programs, or they were not receiving unemployment benefits. Via lottery among 2,880 applicants, 1,746 were selected to receive the cash transfer. The 1,134 who were not selected formed the comparison group. The primary outcome of the study was emergency department visits. As secondary outcomes, researchers investigated four types of emergency department visits. These included: 1) emergency department visits resulting in hospital admission, 2) visits related to behavioral health (including mental health and substance use disorders), 3) visits related to substance use disorders, and 4) visits that were avoidable (i.e., pertaining a health concern that could have been treated outside of the emergency department setting). Researchers included outpatient visits, Covid-19 vaccinations, and biomarkers such as blood pressure, body weight, hemoglobin, and cholesterol as additional outcome variables. The study used health record data from three major health systems to measure these outcomes.", "results_lessons": "After the nine-month study period, results showed that those who received the cash transfer made significantly fewer emergency department visits overall relative to the comparison group. Those who received the cash transfer made fewer emergency department visits that led to a hospital admission and fewer visits related to behavioral health or substance use. There were no significant differences in total outpatient visits nor in other health outcomes measured, however outpatient visits to subspecialists were higher among those who received the cash transfer compared to those that did not. Emergency department visits Those who received the cash transfer had 217.1 emergency department (ED) visits per 1,000 people while the comparison group had 317.5 visits per 1,000 people, or an adjusted difference of 87.0 fewer visits per 1,000 people (a relative decrease of 27 percent). The cash transfer group had 21.6 fewer ED visits related to behavioral health (a 62 percent decrease), 12.8 fewer visits related to substance use (an 87 percent decrease), and 27.3 fewer visits that resulted in hospital admission (a 42 percent decrease). There was no statistically significant impact on potentially avoidable emergency department visits. Outpatient use The cash transfer did not significantly impact the total number of outpatient visits. However, there was an increase of 303.1 subspeciality visits per 1,000 persons for the cash transfer group (a 21 percent increase from a baseline of 1,424.8 subspeciality visits for the comparison group). This effect was larger for those without a car and for visits to clinics further from Chelsea. Other health outcomes There was no significant impact on Covid-19 vaccination rates, nor the measured biomarkers of blood pressure, body weight, hemoglobin, and cholesterol. Overall, the reduction in emergency department visits for those who received the cash transfer may indicate that policies that provide income support can have important benefits for health in the United States. In addition, the study found fewer emergency department visits related to substance use in the cash transfer group, contradicting prior studies and common beliefs that cash transfers will increase substance use and raise alcohol- or substance-related morbidity and mortality. Although the cash transfer did not change utilization of primary care or Covid-19 vaccination rates, which were readily accessible in Chelsea, it increased use of outpatient subspecialty care; the cash transfer may have helped pay for the indirect and direct costs associated with accessing this less accessible form of care. By decreasing the demand for more expensive acute care relative to outpatient care, cash benefits also have the potential to be cost saving to the health care system. Use of results: While the need for this particular intervention in Chelsea dissipated once the economy recovered from the Covid-19 shutdowns, its perceived success led Chelsea to run another cash transfer program providing three months of benefits to 2000 residents starting in January 2023 with the aim of assisting low-income residents with energy costs during winter months.", "citations": "", "run_id": "2026-02-24 182618", "scraped_at": "2026-02-24T18:30:52", "hash": "faebedcccbe19148d9e3c7073ffc8ac8f93b4afff55f915f184a0cd249939707"}

A randomized trial in Kazakhstan", "partners": "", "abstract": "In many low-and-middle-income countries, youth struggle to integrate into society, displaying high levels of social discontent and experiencing economic and political isolation. In Kazakhstan, researchers tested whether offering youth community service grants and training impacted their level of community engagement, pro-social behavior, life skills, and labor market outcomes. Engaging youth in civic service and/or training had little to no effect on these outcomes one-year post-program, with some evidence of negative training effects on labor market outcomes.", "policy_issue": "In low and middle-income countries, where nearly half of the population is under 25, young people often struggle to integrate into society, with limited community engagement and low labor force participation1. To address this issue, many governments have introduced subsidized community service programs, offering youth opportunities to engage in activities that benefit their communities. Policymakers expect these programs to foster social integration by increasing youth’s community engagement and pro-social behavior (voluntary actions intended to benefit others ). Involvement in community service is also anticipated to boost their life skills—the essential abilities for navigating the demands and challenges of everyday life, such as creativity and teamwork—by offering hands-on project experience. Enhanced life skills can in turn improve youth employability and economic integration. Despite the interest in youth community service programs, evidence on their effectiveness is limited. To shed light on this approach, researchers evaluated an intervention in Kazakhstan that provided youth with community service grants paired with life skills training and mentorship.", "context_of_eval": "In Kazakhstan, youth constitute a large proportion of the total population (27 percent were aged 15-24 in 2017) and face significant hurdles, including disengagement from social institutions and a high prevalence of risky behaviors. Less than ten percent of Kazakh youth were involved in community-driven volunteering in 20143 , compared to 23 percent in OECD countries , and only a quarter of youth considered it important to engage in politics and civil society. Kazakhstan also ranked among the highest in youth suicide and mortality rates in the world in 2010 4, and media reports have drawn attention to the growing involvement of youth in political protests and extremism. Challenges extend to economic outcomes: while the share of Kazakh youth who are neither in school nor employed was favorable compared to other countries (9.5 percent in 2016 compared to 14 percent in OECD countries and the United States), the proportion of NEET (not in education, employment, or training) youth has been on the rise since 2012. Additionally, despite the near-universal completion of secondary education in Kazakhstan, analyses of NEET youth have identified limitations in both technical and soft skills as significant barriers to finding employment. 5 In this context, the Government of Kazakhstan launched the Kazakhstan Youth Corps (KYC), a youth community service program funded by the World Bank that offered youth a combination of community service grants with life skills training and mentorship . The piloting phase of the program was implemented in four regions in Kazakhstan, namely Pavlodar, Karaganda, Almaty and South Kazakhstan. The pilot was led by the Coordinating Agency, a group of non-governmental agencies engaged in youth development, under the supervision of the Ministry of Education and Sciences.", "details_inter": "Researchers conducted a randomized evaluation to test the impact of KYC on Kazakh youth’s community engagement, pro-social behavior, life skills, and access to labor market opportunities. Youth aged 18 to 29 were eligible to apply for the program if they had been living in one of the pilot regions for longer than six months. To apply, eligible youth had to sort into groups of three to five people and submit a proposal with an idea for a potential community project. The KYC opportunity was advertised through social media, billboards, posters, and public meetings at universities and local youth centers, resulting in 1320 submitted proposals. After the application period, a committee of local stakeholders examined proposals for their social importance and selected 1113 groups, totaling 3784 youth, to participate in the study. The program took place between August and December 2017. Participant groups were randomly assigned to one of four interventions: Community service grant (295 groups, 998 youth ): Groups were offered a grant of up to US$3,000 to design and implement a community service project for six months. Additionally, each participant received a monthly stipend comparable to an entry-level wage—US$200 per month for university graduates and US$100 for non-graduates. Training program (263 groups, 890 youth): Groups were offered a program that comprised a one-week training focused on life skills and project management, six bi-monthly meetings with a mentor, and a one-week concluding module. The life skills explored in training modules included critical thinking, goal setting, collaboration, team building, and creativity. Combined intervention (294 groups, 1002 youth): Groups were offered both the community service grant and the training intervention. Youth in this group attended the same training sessions as youth in the training-only group. Comparison group (261 groups, 894 youth): Groups were not offered any of the interventions. Researchers surveyed youth about a year after the program to build an index of community engagement and pro-social behavior (combining seven indices of related outcomes, such as civic engagement and interpersonal trust) and a survey tool measuring life skills (combining indices that captured life skills, such as mental health, self-esteem/locus of control, and propensity to work in groups). The survey also captured labor market outcomes, measured as hours worked in the last week, days worked in the last month, income over the last month, and engagement in income-generating activity such as wage labor and self-employment. In addition, researchers used administrative data from the Ministry of Education and Sciences to track the number of beneficiaries of the community service projects, and surveyed community and local government leaders to measure the impact of the program on communities. Leveraging both data sources, researchers tracked program take-up among participants.", "results_lessons": "Overall, program participants experienced no changes in community engagement or life-skills one year after the intervention. Labor market outcomes remained unchanged in all groups but the training-only group, which experienced weakly adverse effects on economic activity and income. Take-up: Program take-up was high, but only in groups that received community grants. Over 91 percent of grant recipients completed their projects, and 88 percent of those receiving the combined intervention reported attending every mentorship session, compared to 41 percent in the training-only group . Additionally, 96 percent of the combined intervention group reported attending both week-long training sessions, while only 58 percent of the training-only group attended. Community engagement and pro-social behavior: Across all three interventions, participants experienced no measurable change in the average index of community engagement and pro-social behavior relative to the comparison group . Life skills: Participants in the three programs also saw no measurable impact on the average life-skills index with respect to the comparison group. Labor market outcomes: Youth in the training-only intervention experienced decreases in work time and income, while participants in the combined and grant-only groups saw no meaningful changes in their labor market outcomes . In the training-only group, youth reported working 3.1 fewer hours the previous week, 1.7 fewer days the previous month, and earning KZT 6,286 (USD 19 ) the previous month than the comparison group, which averaged 28 hours of work the previous week, and 15 days of work and KZT 57,684 (USD 173) in earnings the previous month. These impacts appear to be driven by a decline in wage employment in the training-only group, though researchers could not identify the specific drivers of lower labor market engagement in that group. Labor market outcomes remained mostly unchanged for the grants and combined intervention groups. Community impact: The community service projects reached 150 beneficiaries on average and had a positive perceived impact on the communities they served. Ninety percent of the surveyed community leaders reported that the projects had an impact in their community and 40 percent reported that the impact was substantial . Taken in sum, these results suggest that in the context of Kazakhstan, engaging youth in civic service and training had no meaningful impact on their community engagement. Effects on economic integration were also muted or slightly adverse for those who only received training. This indicates that youth community service programs may need to be justified by reasons other than their impact on the youth delivering the services, such as the potential benefits they offer to service recipients. The estimated cost of the KYC program was around US$1500 per youth receiving the grant and the stipend, with US$780 allocated to the stipend, and US$330 per youth receiving the training and mentorship. The transfers corresponded to 3.1 percent of the per capita GDP in 2017 for the stipend alone and 6.2 percent for the stipend and grant together.", "citations": "", "run_id": "2026-02-24 182618", "scraped_at": "2026-02-24T18:30:52", "hash": "8d609ca100d177898f51afc0b56e86d25d73b15b015d8257424860ba8dfc1fd2"}

Moreover, because they sequester carbon and protect biodiversity, they are vital for environmental well-being.1 Consequently, reducing deforestation and increasing reforestation can contribute to mitigating and building resilience to climate change. Globally, one of deforestation’s main causes is increasing demand for agricultural land. Current evidence shows that formalizing farmers’ land rights can reduce deforestation. This may be partly because farmers with formalized land rights feel more secure in their land-holdings,2 increase long-term land investments,3 and thereby increase land productivity, reducing the need to expand to new, forested land.4 However, it is unclear whether formalizing land rights can increase reforestation, particularly through a technique called Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR), in which tree seeds, roots, and trunks remaining in the soil after past clear cutting are fostered to grow new trees.5 There is observational evidence to suggest that FMNR increases reforestation and crop yields,6 but it has yet to be tested rigorously. Can access to land rights increase take-up of FMNR, and can FMNR increase crop yields and reforestation?", "context_of_eval": "In the 1980s, small-scale farmers in Maradi and Zinder, Niger, began practicing FMNR on their land. Some farmers adopted FMNR independently, to increase their crop yields, while others took up FMNR in response to incentives from international NGOs aiming to increase reforestation.7 Recently, FMNR has become an increasingly important tool for combatting desertification in Niger. Since 2017, the World Agroforestry Center (ICRAF) and World Vision have been implementing a program in Maradi and Zinder called “Regreening Africa,” in which they train farmers in the practice of FMNR, assist farmers in acquiring customary land certificates, and support villages in establishing rules to protect their forests. In 2020, to incentivize farmers to practice FMNR, Niger issued a decree protecting the rights of farmers to harvest resources from trees grown on their land. In Niger, 42 percent of the population lives in extreme poverty and 90 percent live in rural areas. In Zinder and Maradi, agricultural activities constitute 33.5 and 45.6 percent of household income among people experiencing poverty. Farmers in Zinder and Maradi are exposed to climate shocks, such as irregular rainfall or high temperatures, that can impact their crop yields. Female farmers in Niger have limited land rights, potentially limiting their investment into agricultural land and adoption of FMNR.", "details_inter": "In partnership with CIFOR-ICRAF and World Vision, researchers are conducting a randomized evaluation to test the impact of FMNR and formalizing land rights on land tenure, reforestation of land, crop yields, soil fertility, and farmer well-being over three years.

While initial patient-provider interactions can influence a patient’s perception of quality of care, it is less clear if amenities like a short wait time or provider demeanor can influence demand for services, especially underutilized services. Researchers conducted an evaluation to test the impact of offering a high-amenity diagnostic consultation for cataracts at different prices on uptake of an underutilized service—cataract surgery—in Mexico. Lower prices for the high-amenity consultation increased exposure to amenities, which ultimately boosted surgery take-up.", "policy_issue": "Preventive health care services are underutilized in many in low- and middle-income countries, despite their potential to enhance quality of life. This low uptake is due to various factors, including limited information about the quality of available services. One way patients ascertain the quality of health care is via repeated interactions with the health care provider. These encounters can help patients learn about certain aspects of care quality, typically including amenities like perceived clinic efficiency or the way a provider treats a patient. However, the technical quality of care, such as adherence to evidence-based treatment protocols, is harder for a patient to verify. As a result, amenities might influence the demand for health care, even though they do not directly affect health outcomes like clinical quality does. Can providing more amenities and a more comfortable experience during consultations increase patients’ demand for underutilized health services?", "context_of_eval": "In many low-income countries, cataracts, or the clouding of the eye’s lens, are a major cause of blindness among the elderly. The only remedy for severe cataracts is surgery, but its uptake is limited in low-income contexts for reasons such as limited access to high-quality surgeons, high treatment prices, and a lack of knowledge of the costs and benefits of surgery. Latin American countries tend to have low cataract surgery rates per capita compared to other regions. Mexico, the setting for this evaluation, had particularly low rates in 2013, ranking below Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Colombia. A barrier to surgery uptake in Mexico is the long wait time for specialized care: on average, a patient waits 4.7 weeks to see a specialist and another 18.2 weeks to go from diagnosis to surgery in Mexico’s public health care system, where most cataract surgeries are performed. In addition, service quality in many public health care institutions is graded poorly. Given this, many patients turn to private providers for care, such as the cataract surgery clinic the researchers in this study partnered with. This clinic served primarily low-income elderly patients in Mexico City and offered meaningful benefits relative to the public sector. Benefits included care meeting international standards and shorter wait times, which could be as little as two days and were guaranteed to be at least 40 percent shorter than the average four months among public providers. Additionally, the price of basic surgery started at MX$6,400 (roughly US$512) compared to private competitors’ price ranges of MX$15,000 to MX$35,000 (about US$1,200 to US$2,800)1. Offering high-quality services at these lower prices was possible because the clinic charged fees for optional amenities on top of the basic services (diagnostic consultations and cataract surgeries). The available optional amenities included reduced wait times and a more comfortable waiting area at a “premium consultation” facility across the street from the main clinic. While consultations took up a substantial portion of physicians’ time, surgeries represented a much larger share of the clinic’s profits; as such, the clinic was interested in increasing surgery take-up. Approximately 21 percent of the study participants were diagnosed with cataracts and the average wait time at the clinic was 3.5 hours. Additionally, about 37 percent of the patients were male and patients were on average 58 years old.", "details_inter": "In partnership with the cataract surgery clinic, researchers conducted a randomized evaluation to test the impact of offering amenities to patients on cataract surgery take-up rates in Mexico City. From January to April 2013, each of the 2,085 patients that came to the main clinic for a diagnostic consultation were told about three types of available consultations: Basic: Patients in this group waited the standard wait time, were seen by a provider in a standard room, and were provided no additional amenities. This consultation type cost MX$50 (about US$4). Reduced wait time: Patients in this group waited a reduced wait time, were seen by a provider in a standard room, and were provided no additional amenities. This consultation type cost MX$200 (about US$16). Premium: Patients in this group went to the premium facility and waited a reduced wait time, were seen by a provider in an upgraded room, and were provided additional amenities in the form of free soft drinks. The price of this consultation type was randomly varied—MX$250, MX$300, or MX$350 (or roughly US$20, US$24, or US$28). After hearing these three options, patients were given an envelope from a randomly ordered stack that included the randomized price of the premium consultation and were told that they could access the premium consultation at that price. Patients were also informed of the approximate wait time. In addition to data on the offered randomized prices, estimated waiting time provided to patients, and patients’ consultation choice, the researchers also collected data on the diagnosis received following consultation and whether an individual decided to undergo surgery for operable cataracts.", "results_lessons": "A lower price for the premium diagnostic consultation increased the take-up of premium consultations, leading to higher cataract surgery take-up as a result. Consult choice: Each additional hour of expected wait time increased the likelihood that a patient chose the reduced wait time or premium consultation, at any price, by 2.3 and 2.9 percentage points, respectively. Patients assigned to either the MX$250 or MX$300 price group for the premium consultation were approximately 13 percentage points more likely to take up the premium consultation compared to the MX$350 price group. When the randomized incremental price for the additional amenities is lower, patients are less likely to select the consultation with reduced wait time alone. Surgery take-up: When diagnosed with cataracts, patients assigned to the MX$250 or MX$300 price groups for the premium consultation were, respectively, 5 or 6.4 percentage points more likely to go through surgery than the MX$350 group, which had an 8.8 percent take-up rate (a 56.8 percent and 72.7 percent increase, respectively). Researchers estimated that updates in patients’ valuation of surgery due to amenities was a key driver of increases in surgery take-up.

This could be because performance-based incentives on exams could crowd out students’ intrinsic motivation to learn or shift students’ focus away from learning underlying concepts and towards test content. A common method to incentivize an entire student population is to only award prizes to the top performing students who score the highest on the exam, which allows policymakers to easily set a fixed budget for incentives ex ante. However, this approach may encourage high achievers while demotivating lower-achieving students who could feel hopeless to meet the cutoff to win the prize. As a result, structuring incentives this way could risk widening the performance gap. Could an alternative incentive structure motivate more students without increasing inequality in academic performance?", "context_of_eval": "In the early 1990s, the government of Malawi removed primary school enrollment fees, leading to near-universal enrollment levels in grades 1-8. Despite improvements in enrollment, student learning has remained low, even compared to similar contexts. For example, across fifteen countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, 6th graders from Malawi ranked towards the bottom in both reading and mathematics. `1` Chimutu, where this study takes place, is a rural sub-district outside of Malawi’s capital city of Lilongwe. The school system faced several resource constraints at the time of the evaluation in 2014: no classrooms had access to electricity, 33 percent of students did not have their own desk or chair, and the student-to-teacher ratio was 85:1. Further, Malawi's GDP per capita was around USD 362.70. In Malawi, primary school students take exams across six subjects during each of the three terms of the year. Students must pass their final exams to advance grade levels, and 8th grade students must take a national standardized exam to move on to secondary school.", "details_inter": "In partnership with the Africa Future Foundation (AFF) and the Chimutu school district, researchers conducted a randomized evaluation to test the impact of different performance-based incentives on students’ final exam scores and their behavior in Malawi. After the first term baseline exams, researchers randomly assigned 118 grade levels (5th-8th grades) across 31 schools to three different groups: Population-based scholarship: In this group, the students scoring in the top 15 percent in the sub-district on their grade’s final exam earned an award or “scholarship”. Students could choose between either MWK 4,500 (USD 9.70) in cash or an item of similar value like shoes, a school bag, or a uniform. Bin-based incentives: In this group, researchers divided students into smaller groups (bins) of 100 students with similar first term test scores across the district. On the final exam, students who scored in the top 15 percent of their bins could choose from the same award options as in the population-based scholarship group. Comparison group: Students in this group did not compete for any incentive. In the second term, AFF notified students of the incentive, their assigned incentive group, their overall exam rank, their bin rank (when applicable), and what rank they needed to achieve by the final exam to earn an award. AFF shared this information through personalized paper cards after a one-hour information session with students. Researchers measured the impact of the incentive models by comparing students’ final test scores and rankings. Nine months later, researchers also conducted a second follow-up survey and exam for 5th and 6th graders only to collect data on the medium term impact of the program, after incentives had ended. Researchers also collected data on student attendance, study hours, parent and teacher effort as reported by students, and non-cognitive skills like self-esteem, conscientiousness, grit, and motivation.", "results_lessons": "Compared to students who received no incentives at all, the population-based incentive program resulted in lower test scores and motivation to study, especially for the lowest-ranked students. The bin-based incentive program had no impact on test scores. Incentive comprehension and student expectations: Students across groups generally understood the incentive schemes. When quizzed on the details of the programs following the information session, students answered 92 percent of the questions correctly, on average, which fell to 64 percent by the end of the year. Following the programs’ announcement, about 40 percent of students in both incentive programs felt optimistic about their chances of winning, despite the top 15 percent cutoff. Optimism increased to over 60 percent of students around the time of the final exam. Short-term impact on test scores: Students in the bin-based incentive program achieved similar test scores as students in the comparison group, who received no incentive. Students in the population-based incentive group performed 0.27 standard deviations worse on their final exam than students in the comparison group. The negative impacts of the program concentrated among the lowest-ranked students, who also reported lower motivation to study. Medium-term impact on test scores: Nine months after the final exams and award distribution, the negative effects of the population-based incentive scheme disappear. This suggests that the dip in test scores seen previously could reflect students efforts on their final exams, rather than how much they learned during the term. Student effort and non-cognitive skills: Neither incentive scheme impacted the effort that students put forth, as measured by the number of hours they reported studying. However, the population-based incentive lowered student motivation and self-esteem and decreased an index of non-cognitive skills that also included grit and conscientiousness by 0.14 SDs. Teacher and parent effort: Neither incentive scheme impacted teacher or parent effort, though parents indicated awareness of the population-based incentive program and reported discussing it with their children. Taken together, the results suggest that lower ranked students can be demotivated by a performance-based cutoff so far from their current position, as opposed to no performance-based incentive at all. Researchers attribute these results to students' prior knowledge and the learning environment in the schools. Unlike Kremer et al. (2009), which assessed a similar merit-based scholarship in a comparable setting, this study involved students being aware of their rankings, making the population-based scholarship more challenging for lower-scoring students. Additionally, the lack of teacher effort likely reduced the intervention’s effectiveness compared to Kremer et al.

Past interventions focused on growing business networks have mostly targeted male entrepreneurs, so it remains unknown how fostering connections between female business owners may affect firm growth.", "context_of_eval": "Ghana has one of the world’s highest rates of female entrepreneurship. A report from 2021 found that 37.2 percent of all business owners in Ghana were women—the third highest percentage in the world.2 Unemployment in Ghana is lower than in many other sub-Saharan countries, with an unemployment rate of around three percent in 2023.3 This intervention targeted female entrepreneurs who had applied to a Covid-19 Stimulus Fund operated by several local NGOs—the Women’s Empowerment & Investment Group (WEIG), Annan Capital Partners (ACP), and GUBA Foundation. This opportunity offered funding (US$2,000-5,000) to women-owned businesses, and the application form attempted to identify firms with high potential for growth. As a result, the entrepreneurs targeted for this intervention may have been more proactive or determined to grow their businesses than the owners of the average Ghanaian microenterprise. Over thirty percent of women who participated in the evaluation had college degrees. Entrepreneurs were involved in a range of industries, including tailoring, retail for food and groceries, and hair care.", "details_inter": "Researchers partnered with WEIG, ACP, and GUBA to access a pool of 3,931 applicants to Ghana’s Covid-19 Stimulus Fund. From this pool, researchers randomly selected 1,488 firms with a female entrepreneur aged 18 years or older who spoke English or Twi, and who provided information about their industry to participate in the study. To bolster study numbers, the researchers recruited an additional 283 entrepreneurs for a total of 1,771 participants. These individuals were then randomly assigned into one of the three following groups: 1. Intervention Group 1 (Online Networking Groups, 704 individuals)—Individuals in this group were assigned to a WhatsApp group of eight other entrepreneurs, paired by preference of collaboration type and the relevant industry. After an introductory call between all members, women were offered the chance to gather in weekly virtual calls with one other member of the group. After all group members had met, the entrepreneurs were re-assigned to a second group to repeat this networking process. These entrepreneurs also gained access to other entrepreneurs’ contact information via an online directory. The entrepreneurs could then ask the research team to help connect them with another firm in the study. Individuals in this group were also provided with a video that explained the benefits of building business networks. Half of the participants in Intervention Groups 1 and 2 were assigned to WhatsApp groups with shared education levels, while the other half of participants in Intervention Groups 1 and 2 were assigned to groups with mixed educational experience. 2. Intervention Group 2 (Online Networking Groups + Legal Support, 608 individuals)—In addition to receiving all of the components provided to Intervention Group 1, individuals in this group were also provided with legal support. Each week during the four-month intervention, these entrepreneurs received a video lesson taught by a Ghanaian corporate lawyer, in addition to free private consultations with this lawyer. These lessons described the potential benefits and legal risks that could arise from inter-business collaboration (e.g. the role of trademarks and the importance of business registration). 3. Comparison Group (436 individuals)—Individuals in this group were only offered the video explaining the benefits of business networking and collaboration.", "results_lessons": "Individuals participating in the online networking groups had higher levels of business innovation, improvements in business practices, and higher profits than individuals in the comparison group. The results between Intervention Groups 1 and 2 were similar, hinting that the addition of legal aid was not a driver of these positive firm outcomes. Business Innovation: A year after the intervention, individuals in both Intervention Groups employed 33 to 36 percent (9.39 to 10.2 percentage points from a baseline of 28.6 percent) more measures of business innovation than individuals in the control group. Entrepreneurs in Intervention Groups 1 and 2 were 7.38 percentage points and 7.44 percentage points more likely, respectively, to sell a new or improved product contrasted with the comparison group rate of 16.3 percent. Entrepreneurs were 10.6 and 7.33 percentage points percent more likely to employ new marketing or selling channels compared to 12.8 percent of comparison-group entrepreneurs. Business Practices: Individuals in both Intervention Groups improved their overall business practices, with an overall index of business practices rising by 0.1 to 0.2 standard deviations relative to the comparison group. This business index covered 22 different activities, such as the likelihood of advertising in the past six months or negotiating lower prices with a supplier. These effects appear to have been driven by improvements to marketing and financial planning. Entrepreneurs in Intervention Groups 1 and 2 improved their financial planning and marketing abilities, for example by increasing their use of advertising and special offers. Sales and Profits: Entrepreneurs in both Intervention Groups did not increase their monthly sales. However, they did increase their monthly profits by 26 to 27 percent, an increase of around 350 cedis ($US 22) from an average of 1,323 cedis ($US 84) in the comparison group. Researchers hypothesized that this shift occurred due to increased business efficiency, as entrepreneurs cut down on costs and boosted profitability from the same amount of sales. The increase in profits was driven by entrepreneurs in the 60th percentile of profits and above, suggesting the intervention had particularly strong effects on a high-achieving subset of firms. Researchers also observed a meaningful shift in the type of entrepreneurs’ collaborations, which they highlighted as a key mechanism for overall impacts on firm outcomes. Study participants in both Intervention Groups reduced the number of collaborations with friends and family members, replacing these collaborations with new partnerships with business partners. Researchers posited this change was driven by a shift in how entrepreneurs perceived the quality of their collaborators, increasing the perceived quality of collaborating with fellow business owners compared to before the intervention. Researchers also noted the importance of learning from well-educated and diverse peers: entrepreneurs paired with more-educated individuals were more likely to innovate and have higher profits, while entrepreneurs paired with individuals largely from the same industry were less likely to see improved business outcomes. Overall, researchers found that providing low-cost online networking groups meaningfully impacted entrepreneurs’ business behaviors, increasing innovation and boosting profits. Researchers are conducting qualitative interviews with participants and will examine longer-run effects of the program to better understand how the program impacted entrepreneurs.", "citations": "Asiedu, Edward, Monica Lambon-Quayefio, Francesca Truffa, and Ashley Wong. 2023. \"Female Entrepreneurship and Professional Networks.\" PEDL Research Paper.

The researchers also evaluated additional religious messages that stressed the importance of girls’ education over child marriage. The edutainment intervention was effective in changing the perceptions of girls and parents towards child marriage.", "policy_issue": "Research suggests that child marriage continues to be a peril in many low and middle-income countries despite improvements in access to education and socioeconomic conditions. There are several risks for girls associated with child marriage such as health complications, early pregnancy, divorce, losing social networks and connections, and lower educational attainment. One of the reasons why child marriage continues to be a challenge is the societal norms and perceptions that justify such practices. Informational and awareness campaigns have been widely used to change popular perceptions and behaviors. However, the data on the impact of such campaigns on child marriage is inadequate. One increasingly popular type of informational campaign to address norms is an edutainment intervention. This intervention presents content in a more relatable and easily acceptable manner. In addition, it presents the audience with an alternate behavior that they can aspire to emulate—potentially addressing any existing harmful norms. Can an edutainment intervention address the norms and perceptions surrounding the costs and benefits of child marriages? Do additional religious messages aimed at promoting education included within edutainment campaigns have differentiated impacts on the norms and perceptions of adolescents and their parents?", "context_of_eval": "According to UNICEF in 2016, Indonesia ranked seventh-highest globally in terms of the number of women marrying before the age of eighteen. The incidence of child marriage exceeded twenty percent in sixteen out of the 38 districts in East Java (which is one of the regions where the intervention takes place). Despite the high incidence of child marriages in Indonesia, most impact evaluations and systematic reviews have focused on South Asia and Africa. In contrast to the South Asian context where bride price and parents play a significant role in such decisions, parents do not necessarily exercise complete control in determining child marriage in Indonesia. In most cases, the marriage decisions involve a negotiation between the parents and adolescents, with some external societal influence. In Indonesia, strong religious views also shape some of the norms and beliefs related to child marriage. The fear of pre-marital sex among adolescents is one of the most common justifications for child marriage among the study participants. This intervention targets 13–15-year-old junior high school girls and parents. On average, participants in this study perceived the allowable age for marriage for girls to be twenty, with the ideal age to be 22 years. They also perceived girls around seventeen to be too young to get married, probably because the legal marriageable age for women in Indonesia is nineteen years.", "details_inter": "In partnership with Fatayat Nadhlatul Ulama—the female wing of Nadhlatul Ulama (NU), which is one of the biggest voluntary religious organizations in the country, and the District Offices of Education, researchers conducted a randomized evaluation to test the effectiveness of a short movie sent via WhatsApp on norms and perceptions concerning child marriage. The intervention targeted adolescent girls in East and Central Java; however, parents of adolescent girls and boys, as well as adolescent boys, also participated. The researchers randomly assigned 261 schools in six districts in two provinces into three groups: Short film group (89 schools, 805 girls): Girls in this group received a short edutainment movie, along with a health message clip on Covid-19 prevention. The film focused on the costs of child marriage (such as health risks, early pregnancy, divorce, and losing connections with friends), and the benefits of delaying it (such as higher educational attainment and connections with friends). They collaborated with a documentary movie director who then hired trained actors for the short film. The actors followed a script to ensure cultural and contextual compatibility. Short film on alternative religious views group (85 schools, 714 girls): Girls in this group received a modified version of the original short film that included alternative religious views along with the Covid-19 clip. This film included messages about religious views delivered by male religious clerks, who are influential in marriage decisions in this context. The religious message in the short film highlighted that marriage is not a mandatory act as per Islam, however, education is. This was an important message to reiterate that religion does not advocate for child marriage as a way to prevent sexual activity1, and religious obligation to attain education precedes any marriage obligations. Comparison group (87 schools, 928 girls): Girls in this group only watched the Covid-19 prevention clip. Researchers measured the impact on perceptions related to child marriage by asking the participants to respond to statements related to the benefits of child marriage, risks of child marriage, and benefits of delaying marriage. Here, they also confirmed whether the participants had completed watching the film and whether they watched it alone. Ethical Considerations One of the biggest challenges researchers faced in designing the intervention was adding messages with an alternative religious view due to concerns about potential backlash as a result of incorrect framing. They consulted scholars working on child marriage and religion to ensure the messaging was precise. Before rolling out their full study, they also conducted focus group discussions and piloted their tools to ensure the message was received as intended.", "results_lessons": "The edutainment campaign improved the girls’ perceptions regarding the benefits of delaying child marriage and the risks associated with child marriage. In addition, the campaign including alternate religious views lowered girls’ perceptions about the benefits of child marriage. Girls’ perceptions towards child marriage: The girls in the short film group had more progressive perceptions overall towards child marriage, measured by a difference of 0.113 standard deviations on the researcher’s constructed perception scale than girls in the comparison group. Further analysis found that the intervention did not change their perceptions of the benefits of child marriage, but improved their perception of the risks of child marriage and the benefits of delaying marriage. The short film on alternative religious views group also had more progressive overall perceptions towards child marriage, measured by a 0.191 standard deviation higher perception score than the comparison group. Further analysis found that the intervention led to an improved perception of the benefits of child marriage, and also improved the perception of the risks of child marriage and the benefits of delaying marriage. Hence, the short film on alternative religious views had larger effects on girls’ overall perceptions of child marriage than the short film intervention alone, driven by more progressive perceptions of the benefits of child marriage. Parents’ perceptions regarding child marriage: Both interventions improved parents’ overall perceptions of child marriage (0.112 for the short film group and 0.187 for the short film on alternative religious views group). The addition of the alternative religious component didn’t have different impacts on overall perceptions but had larger impacts on parents’ perceptions of the risks of child marriage compared to the short film. Upon further investigation, the authors found this was due to parents’ being reminded of the loss of social networks for their daughters if they married early. Boys’ perceptions regarding child marriage: The researchers test the impact of the same short film on adolescent boys. The intervention did not change boys’ overall and thematic perceptions. Given that the intervention was designed for girls and their parents, the lack of impact on boys was not surprising. Girls’ perceptions regarding women’s agency: Researchers tested whether the edutainment intervention changed other perceptions on an issue that was not targeted by the intervention, women’s agency. They didn’t find any impacts, suggesting that edutainment interventions should be carefully designed to target desired attitudes and norms. In sum, this edutainment intervention on the costs of child marriage was effective in changing the perceptions of girls and parents. Including alternative religious views was effective in this context. The researchers suggest that policymakers designing edutainment interventions keep their target outcomes and audience in mind when designing such interventions, and consider whether and how the addition of religion may be relevant for their context. Schools may be an effective avenue for implementing these interventions.", "citations": "Irhamni, Milda, and Gumilang Aryo Sahadewo. “Challenging Norms and Perceptions on Child Marriage among Adolescent Girls in Indonesia: A Randomized Experiment,” August 9, 2023. https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4534525.", "run_id": "2026-02-24 182618", "scraped_at": "2026-02-24T18:30:52", "hash": "bc3a2eccb720af695ff8c06b724800f41b7ddce8c6f924792302cf421a0f4e8c"}

Researchers hypothesize two pathways by which unconditional cash transfers may improve childhood health outcomes. First, mothers may use the money to invest in high-quality resources such as nutritious foods, preventative healthcare, a separate sleep space, and safe housing. Second, the money may reduce financial strain and thereby reduce parental stress and mental health symptoms, which may in turn improve family interactions, bedtime routines, and child sleep quality.

The larger payment amounted to a 20 percent boost in participants’ annual income on average. In this paper, researchers analyzed data on child health, nutrition, sleep, and healthcare utilization as reported by mothers in surveys at years one, two, and three.

The high cash transfer increased child consumption of produce at age two by .17 standard deviations, or 7.6 percent more servings of fresh produce per day. This effect was primarily driven by fruit consumption, where children in the high-cash group consumed 11.2 percent more servings of fresh fruit per day than the low-cash gift group. Researchers posit that the cash gift allowed mothers to take the financial risk of purchasing fresh produce, which they may have otherwise been hesitant to buy due to fears their children would reject it. Researchers did not find a statistically significant impact of the high cash transfer on other nutrition outcomes, health, sleep, or healthcare utilization at ages one, two, or three. While the intervention did increase the income of families by nearly 20 percent, most of the families were still living in poverty, so it is possible that it was not a sufficient amount of money to surmount barriers to accessing preventative healthcare or improving sleep (e.g., maternal stress or housing quality). It is also possible that impacts on health will not emerge until later on in life, as many diseases associated with childhood poverty, such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease, tend to emerge in adolescence or adulthood.

Researchers conducted a randomized evaluation to test how encouraging traditional leaders to broaden their circle of advisors affects inclusive governance in Zimbabwe.

Scholars have suggested that traditional institutions may fail to govern inclusively due to low accountability, concentration of decision-making power in a single leader, and bias against individuals with lower traditional status, including women. While many interventions attempt to replace traditional political institutions with new, more democratic structures, there is growing evidence that this approach yields limited improvements in governance. The existence of advisory councils in many traditional political institutions challenges the assumption that decisions are made unilaterally without any collective deliberation. The researchers of this study theorize that broadening the composition of the advisors – and the demographic and social groups represented by them – can help improve inclusive decision-making and accountability within traditional political institutions.", "context_of_eval": "In rural Zimbabwe, village chiefs, also known as village heads, play an important role in local governance. This may include managing village courts, distributing land within the community, presiding over village assembly meetings, and facilitating the delivery of goods and services, such as the distribution of food aid. In pre-colonial times, there was a tradition of village chiefs ruling with advisory bodies, engaging in collective decision making with advisors. During the 1980s, the government attempted to replace traditional political institutions with elected village governments; however, these attempts were unsuccessful. Over the last decades, the government has opted instead to work alongside traditional leaders. This study was conducted in the Mutare District in eastern Zimbabwe, comprised predominantly of people belonging to the Shona group. Village chiefs in this district inherit their leadership through patrilineal lineage and serve for a lifetime. Historically, Shona traditional leaderships could be considered inclusive, participatory, and egalitarian. Major decisions in the village are expected to involve all family heads, villages tend to be open to in-migration from people of varying lineages, and courts are generally treated as an open forum with decisions based on public consensus. While Shona traditional political institutions did not historically treat women and unmarried men as equals, this evolved over time and in the study area, many villages had headwomen. At the time of this evaluation in 2012-13, there were strong political divides in the villages, affecting local governance. Nearly all villages in the study area (94 percent) had an advisory council, comprising about six people. Advisors varied in both their representativeness of the community and the manner in which they engaged with the wider community. Most adults (86 percent) in the villages belonged to at least one civil society group. In the study villages, civil society leadership consisted of religious leaders, farm group leaders, volunteer village health workers, and caregiver group leaders. Before the study, village advisors did not fully represent the diverse interests and opinions held by civil society leaders. There were differences in opinions on the level of power courts should have, demographics, economic status, political allegiance, and knowledge of law between advisors and civil society leaders, creating an opportunity to broaden representation within village advisory councils.", "details_inter": "Researchers conducted a randomized evaluation to test if encouraging traditional leaders to have a broader group of advisors can lead to more inclusive governance in Zimbabwe. The study comprised 270 villages in Mutare District in eastern Zimbabwe, divided into 35 blocks of villages, where villages in the same ward and on the same land classification comprised a block. Within each block, researchers randomly assigned villages to one of three groups: Workshops for village chief (69 villages): In these villages, village chiefs were offered workshops on laws and norms that promote inclusion and transparency in governance. A local NGO with experience working with high-level traditional leaders on similar themes delivered the content during two different three-day workshops, separated by several months and taking place between September 2012 – May 2013. Workshops for village chiefs and civil society leaders (65 villages): In these villages, village chiefs were asked to invite a local civil society leader that was not already part of their council to attend the workshops with them. The intention was to provide civil society leaders with increased knowledge on traditional governance, access to the chief, and new status as an advisor. Comparison group (136 villages): There was no workshop conducted in these villages in the timeframe of the evaluation. Researchers measured the impact of providing workshops for just village chiefs and workshops for village chiefs with civil society leaders on three key outcomes: inclusive decision-making processes, impartiality and effectiveness of decision-making outcomes, and the legitimacy of traditional institutions. Researchers surveyed village chiefs, civil society leaders, and households in August and September 2013, more than three months after the last workshop. Survey data was coupled with qualitative interviews conducted in 10 villages one year after the surveys to evaluate the effect of the program. Zimbabwe is an electoral authoritarian regime, and individuals’ political opinions are often a sensitive issue. As a result, the study was designed and implemented to ensure multiple levels of protection for respondents. For example, to protect respondents, the researchers collected identifying information on separate cover sheets that could not be linked back to the main surveys in the field. To maintain confidentiality of village heads and villages as a whole, the researchers used codes for different communities, which were filled out in advance before teams entered the field to avoid sending the codebook into the field. In addition, they used prompts not recorded on the survey instrument and alphabetic and numeric codes to record responses to sensitive questions.", "results_lessons": "Village chiefs improved their decision-making processes when they attended the workshop on inclusive and transparent governance and were accompanied by a civil society member. Notably, decision-making processes became more open and decision-making outcomes for political opponents of the chief improved, including by reducing bias in the distribution of food aid and court rulings. Inclusive decision-making processes: Researchers measured inclusive decision-making through an index of diversity of advisory council membership, level of consultation with other governance bodies, and the transparency of local bureaucratic proceedings. When only the village chief attended the workshop, decision-making processes did not change. However, when a civil society leader accompanied the village chief, researchers found that inclusive decision-making improved significantly (with an increase in more than half a standard deviation in inclusive decision-making). Decision-making outcomes: Researchers measured the effect of the intervention on decision making outcomes based on efficacy in managing local issues, as well as the level of impartiality in decision making with respect to political opponents receiving food aid and perceived fairness of court decisions. When chiefs attended workshops alone, there was no significant effect on the impartiality of decisions; however, when civil society leaders also joined the workshops, the impartiality of decisions improved by 13 percentage points (from a base of 43 percent in the comparison group). With respect to management of local problems, when the chief attended workshops alone, the percentage of households whose food needs were met increased; however, there was a negative effect on dispute management. Meanwhile, the workshops including the civil society leader led to small improvements in both food security and dispute resolution. Village chief’s legitimacy: When the chief and civil society leader attended the workshop together, the village chief’s legitimacy improved slightly. When the village chief attended alone, their legitimacy decreased slightly. While all village chiefs were instructed to bring a new civil society leader in the second intervention, about one quarter brought existing traditional advisers instead. Researchers found that among the village chiefs who were likely to bring new civil society leaders to the workshop, the inclusiveness and impartiality of decision-making would tend to increase. Conversely, in villages where the chiefs were likely to bring existing advisors, the workshops may decrease inclusive and impartial decision-making. This research finds that expanding the village chief’s circle of advisors with a new member of civil society, that represents previously underrepresented interests and communities, can make village-level decision-making processes and outcomes more inclusive and impartial, as well as increase the effectiveness of local dispute management. Qualitative interviews indicated that civil society leaders gained new information and developed stronger relationships with the chief by joining the workshop, allowing for increased deliberation and facilitating more inclusive governance. This study thus indicates that it is possible to make gradual improvements to governance within traditional political institutions, as opposed to replacing them. Additional research on the long-term effects of broadening traditional leader’s advisors on inclusive governance can shed further light on how to improve local governance.", "citations": "", "run_id": "2026-02-24 182618", "scraped_at": "2026-02-24T18:30:52", "hash": "7b51f8054c270041519dd6b61d3540fbd7cac9130377d2cf0d8662c46e0c5eb4"}

The primary schools in the study population had an average of 36 students per class and six grade levels. The typical teacher was a woman who had completed thirteen years of education and teaching experience of around fourteen years. Additionally, the average household head was a mother of 35 years and four years of schooling. In this setting, 22 percent of households knew that colds could spread between people, and less than 20 percent mentioned using soap before cooking. A shortage of materials did not explain the low use of soap, as over 90 percent of households had soap, and 99 percent had access to tube wells with potable water.", "details_inter": "Researchers conducted a randomized evaluation to test the impact of an edutainment intervention at schools and the provision of handwashing resources at home on handwashing at home and at school. As part of the intervention, researchers provided a soap dispenser mounted on the wall which included a time-stamped sensor, designed in collaboration with the MIT Media Lab, and provided liquid soap. The time-stamped sensor provided an objective measurement method and allowed the researchers to overcome measurement challenges that can come from relying only on self-reported outcomes. At schools, researchers varied handwashing rates by randomizing a hygiene edutainment program across classrooms. At households, researchers randomized the distribution of hand soap dispensers and randomly varied the share of students per classroom who had a dispenser at home. The study sample included 150 classrooms from 26 public elementary schools corresponding to 775 rural households in 52 villages. Each participating household had at least one child in the sample classrooms and participating students needed to have attended at least 60 percent of school days in the prior month. All classrooms had access to soap dispensers. The study sample was stratified by school and the intervention was randomized at the classroom level: Edutainment high-saturation group (37 classrooms): Students in this group watched a series of short videos on hand hygiene sourced from publicly available programs twice per week, with content rotating every six weeks. Additionally, 332 students were given access to soap dispensers at home. Edutainment low-saturation group (39 classrooms): Students in this group watched the same edutainment videos as in the high-saturation group, but only 87 students were given access to soap dispensers at home. No edutainment high-saturation group (28 classrooms): Students in this group did not watch any videos, and 260 students were given access to soap dispensers at home. No edutainment low-saturation group (46 classrooms): Students in this group did not watch any videos, and only 96 students were given access to soap dispensers at home. Researchers conducted initial surveys at schools and households in September and October 2019, respectively, accompanied by the installation of hand soap dispensers. The edutainment intervention occurred twice weekly after the baseline survey collection and the final delivery on March 14, 2020. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions, researchers conducted the final household surveys via phone in April 2020. The main outcomes of interest were child health and daily handwashing rates. Child health outcomes were collected monthly by asking mothers to report the incidence of their child's diarrhea and respiratory illness. Researchers calculated daily handwashing rates for five months using the time-stamped sensor included in each hand soap dispenser. In addition to receiving ethical review and approvals from an institutional review board, researchers made efforts to address and account for ethical questions by providing all households and classrooms in the study with hand soap dispensers and liquid soap. While this prevented the presence of a pure comparison group, it was informed by existing evidence of the positive benefits of dispenser provision on child handwashing behavior and health outcomes.", "results_lessons": "The edutainment intervention increased handwashing at school and decreased handwashing at home, reducing total handwashing. Similarly, inducing children to wash more at home led to considerably less washing at school. These findings suggest that encouraging behavior change in one setting may crowd out like behavior in another setting. Handwashing behavior at school. The edutainment interventions increased daily handwashing rates in the classroom by 8.9 percentage points relative to the comparison group average of 25.2 percent (a 35 percent increase). Handwashing rates among classrooms in the edutainment groups persisted during the five-month evaluation, while those in comparison classrooms gradually decreased. School-to-home behavioral transmission. Conversely, the edutainment interventions reduced handwashing behavior at home. On average, a student in an edutainment classroom washed 0.28 more times per day at school while a student and their family washed 0.37 fewer times per school day at home. Households with a child from an edutainment classroom decreased daily handwashing rates in the household by 0.37 percentage points relative to the comparison group average of 5.2 percent (a 7 percent decrease), suggesting that the intervention led to an overall negative impact on handwashing behavior for a child and their family. Home-to-school behavioral transmission. Similarly, classrooms in the high-saturation groups showed lower washing levels at school. The daily handwashing rate for classrooms where 25 percent of students had hand soap dispensers at home was 3.3 percentage points lower relative to a 30.63 percent average for classrooms with only two children with dispenser (an 11 percent difference), suggesting there was no positive behavior transmission from households to the school. Researchers found that decreases in handwashing in children’s homes in the edutainment group were driven mainly by lower handwashing rates in the after-school hours and on weekends. Researchers suggest that two mechanisms might explain the negative behavioral transmission of handwashing from school to home and home to school: handwashing at home may be crowded out as children wash more at school, and children may grow to associate hand washing with the classroom over the week. Child health. Researchers found some suggestive evidence of an increase in the reported incidence of loose stool and respiratory infection symptoms among children in the edutainment groups. Researchers found that a low-cost edutainment intervention at schools reduced overall handwashing. These unintended effects emphasize the importance of using caution when interpreting previous studies and the design of related programs. Moreover, while the study focuses on hand hygiene behavior, researchers cautioned that similar unintended effects might exist for other interventions where behaviors are expected to be practiced beyond the implementation setting, such as in workplaces or community-building efforts.", "citations": "", "run_id": "2026-02-24 182618", "scraped_at": "2026-02-24T18:30:52", "hash": "b59707c3efd3eecf5a2f08124e106cb06be665e463d74101160e8cc0c8b7d75e"}

However, many people in low- and middle-income countries face barriers such as long travel times to bank branches and high transaction costs, limiting their engagement with the banking system. Mobile banking services could offer a solution by linking people’s bank accounts to their mobile phones, reducing the need for physical bank visits. However, people may be hesitant to take up mobile banking, as with many new technologies, due to limited knowledge of the technology and the absence of clear instructions for how to make transactions. Dissemination of information through peer-to-peer learning is a common strategy to increase uptake of new technologies. However, this strategy is expensive and time consuming. An alternative strategy is harnessing mobile phones to reach large populations with information quickly; however, SMS campaigns have mixed success particularly in contexts with low literacy rates or when they lack engaging content. Can providing information through Interactive Voice Response (IVR) calls, a process of sending pre-recorded voice messages directly to individuals’ mobile phones, encourage the adoption of mobile banking services and improve financial behaviors such as savings and loan repayment?", "context_of_eval": "This study took place in Ghana, a country where mobile money account ownership has increased in recent years, reaching 60 percent of adults in 2021, up from 13 percent in 2014. The increase was partly driven by innovation during the Covid-19 pandemic during which physical access to bank branches was restricted, making the need for remote banking solutions more salient. However, actual engagement with mobile banking has remained low, with only 37 percent of adults in Ghana using a mobile bank account to save money. One of the major providers of banking services to low-income and under-banked populations in Ghana is a microfinance organization called Opportunity International Savings and Loans Limited (OISL). OISL has 38 branches for 500,000 clients throughout all of Ghana, making it difficult for many clients to access banking services due to long travel times and high costs. The average travel time to a bank branch by public transport was fifty minutes each way with average travel costs of 24 cedis (US$2.12) in 2020 at the time of the study. Participants in the study had a current account with OISL and were registered for mobile banking, but had not made a Mobile Banking transaction in the previous month. The average participant was forty years old and from locations throughout Ghana. Participants had an average savings balance of about 300 Cedis (US$50), though half had less than 11 Cedis (US$1.83) saved.", "details_inter": "Researchers partnered with Opportunity International Savings and Loans Limited (OISL) to conduct a randomized evaluation to test the impact of high-frequency interactive voice response (IVR) calls on people’s use of mobile banking services and other financial behaviors. Researchers randomly assigned 15,000 OISL clients to one of three groups: Mobile Banking IVR (5,000 clients): This group received ten weekly IVR calls highlighting the benefits and features of mobile banking along with general advice on good financial behavior, such as saving and making loan repayments on time. Half of these calls were followed by SMS texts repeating the instructions for performing digital transactions. Savings IVR (5,000 clients): This group received ten weekly IVR calls encouraging good financial behavior, such as saving and making loan repayments on time but without any information on mobile banking. Comparison (5,000 clients): This group did not receive any IVR calls. Researchers recorded the IVR calls in two local languages and English, and sent them to participants once a week from August to November 2020. Before, during, and after the intervention, researchers collected administrative records from OISL on all participants including data on transactions, saving account balances, and loan history. Researchers also conducted a phone survey through IVR immediately after the intervention ended. Clients responded to questions about their saving behavior, bank visits, and their use and knowledge of Mobile Banking using their phone keypad. Fifteen percent of participants answered at least one question in the phone survey.", "results_lessons": "People who received the mobile banking IVR calls were more likely to use mobile banking, with the strongest effect on women and people above 40 years old. Receiving the savings IVR calls did not increase people’s use of mobile banking. Neither IVR call encouraged people to save; however, people who received the mobile banking IVR calls were more likely to make on-time loan repayments and take out loans five months after the intervention. Use of mobile banking services: Across the four months of the study, on average, 8.7 percent of clients who received the mobile banking IVR calls made at least one mobile banking transaction each month, a 6.3 percentage point increase from 2.4 percent in the comparison group (an over 250 percent increase). In addition, participants in the mobile banking IVR group made monthly mobile transactions about triple the value of those made by people who did not receive the messages, increasing the monthly transaction value from 11 Cedis (US$1.83) to about 40 Cedis (US$6.67). People who received the savings IVR message did not make more transactions than those in the comparison group, suggesting that information on the importance of saving and repaying loans is not enough to change behavior—provision of information on how to make a mobile transaction was critical to increasing mobile bank use. Five months after the intervention ended, 4.2 percent of people who had received the mobile banking IVR calls were still making a transaction once a month, a 1.3 percentage point increase from 2.8 percent of the comparison group (a 50 percent increase), demonstrating the lasting effects of the IVR messages on clients’ behaviors. Effects on women and by age: The effects of the IVR calls on women’s use of mobile banking was slightly larger than the effect on men, which researchers posit may be because women were less likely to make mobile transactions prior to the start of the intervention than men. Similarly, older participants (over forty years old) who received the IVR calls were more likely to increase their use of mobile banking than younger participants, perhaps because they were more likely to listen to the messages than younger generations. Savings behavior: Neither clients who received mobile banking or savings IVRs were more likely to save using their OISL accounts during the intervention or five months after the intervention. Loan repayment behavior: Participants who received the mobile banking IVR calls were 2.4 percentage points less likely to have made a late loan repayment, compared to a 29.5 percent late repayment rate among clients in the comparison group (an 8 percent decrease). People who received the savings IVR calls did not increase their likelihood of making on-time payments compared to those in the comparison group. According to OISL staff, late repayments were common during the Covid-19 pandemic because clients were unable to travel regularly to the bank, hindering people from taking out new loans. People who received the mobile banking IVR calls were 1.9 percentage points more likely to have a loan five months after the end of the intervention compared to 17.2 percent in the comparison group (an 11 percent increase), demonstrating how mobile banking contributed to facilitating access to credit through easier loan repayment. Researchers argue the IVR calls present a cost-effective approach to increasing people’s use of mobile banking as the cost of an IVR message is similar to that of an SMS message. Due to the combination of human touch and practical guidance, IVR helped people adopt mobile banking services and reduced the burden on people to make costly trips to the bank. OISL have continued to use IVR messages to inform their clients about their services", "citations": "", "run_id": "2026-02-24 182618", "scraped_at": "2026-02-24T18:30:52", "hash": "65bb9732ebbc51b1caaef1adc24d45149e6f6489151601e88f4e3487a136e2f9"}

Colombian NGOs reported a 250 percent increase in cases of GBV in the last weekend of March 2020. Moreover, it is estimated that 2.5 million jobs were lost due to the Covid-19 crisis and related lockdowns, while unemployment rose by 50 percent, from 10 to 15.9 percent. In this setting, every formal worker was obligated to join a family compensation fund. Fund members with low wages received a bimonthly money transfer to cover some household expenses. All members of the study population were minimum wage formal workers, making them eligible for this financial subsidy, and received their subsidy from the family compensation fund Confama. Despite this economic support, on average, the study population had more debt than savings prior to the intervention. Only fourteen percent of participants saved in a bank. Many participants had debt to banks or informal debts, including to loan sharks. Antioquia, where this study takes place, was particularly affected by violence in the past during Colombia’s armed conflict. As a result, certain social protection services had a weaker presence in Antioquia than in other Colombian states. Before the intervention, 40 percent of women reported experiencing at least one incident of domestic violence in the previous year, which aligns with the national average. LISTA Familia, the study’s main program, was delivered via a purpose-built WhatsApp platform and adopted from a previously successful, tablet-based financial education intervention called LISTA. The intervention had two main components: an intelligent bot for individual users and a moderated group chat. The intelligent bot, ConHector, responded to participant input by providing information about Covid-19, financial planning, and communicating with intimate partners. ConHector provided information about assertive communication, dealing with disagreement, fair division of household labor, and gender norms.

This initiative was made possible through the collaboration with a non-profit organization called OpenEdu. Using curriculum from eight top Russian universities, any Russian university can pay a small fee to gain access to fully online or blended courses for their students on OpenEdu, taught by more experienced professors. Both in-person, online, and blended courses can meet Russia’s Federal State Education Standards, including most courses on the OpenEdu platform, meaning all students are exposed to standardized course content. Three universities participated in the evaluation. Researchers selected universities based on their willingness to integrate online courses from OpenEdu and replace an in-person course for a second-year cohort of STEM students. These universities ranked in the bottom half of 458 higher education institutions in Russia. The participating cohorts included 98 mechanical engineering students from the first university, 140 civil engineering students from the second, and 87 mechanical engineering students from the third.", "details_inter": "Researchers conducted a randomized evaluation to compare the effect of in-person, online, or blended STEM classes on student achievement in Russia. Researchers partnered with three resource-constrained universities that required students in selected majors to take Engineering Mechanics (EM) or Construction Materials Technology (CMT). The researchers randomly assigned second-year students from the selected majors to complete the courses under one of three conditions: In-person group (101 students): Students attended the EM or CMT classes fully in-person with the same instructors that usually teach at their university. Students attended a lecture with up to 300 other classmates and then participated in smaller discussion groups of up to 30 students. Online group (124 students): Students took the same course but fully online through the OpenEdu platform, with content produced and delivered by professors based at highly ranked federal university. Students completed course assignments online and did not participate in discussion groups. Blended group (100 students): Students took the same course, but in a blended format where lectures were held online through OpenEdu as in the online group, while discussion groups were in-person with the same professors as in the in-person group. The researchers considered three student outcomes: final exam grade, average grade on course assignments, and satisfaction with the course. Additionally, they assessed the cost-effectiveness of scaling different instructional models. Before the classes started, students completed a pretest to gauge their understanding of course content and a questionnaire about their sociodemographic characteristics. After the course, students reported their satisfaction with the course and completed a final exam. Additionally, researchers collected data on the instructors’ sociodemographic background, research experience, and teaching experience.", "results_lessons": "Students from in-person, online, and blended courses scored similarly on the final exam. In terms of average assessment scores, students in the in-person and blended groups performed equally well, whereas those in the online group performed better. While blended and in-person students had similar satisfaction levels with their course, online students were less satisfied than in-person students. The online and blended model demonstrated cost savings. Final exam scores: Across all three groups, students received comparable final exam scores. Average grade across all course assessments: The average assessment score varied by teaching model: students who took the course online scored 7.2 percentage points higher than students in the in-person and blended groups (for an overall score of 81.6 percent up from 74.4 percent), who had similar average assessment scores. However, researchers suggest this difference is likely because online students had three chances to submit their weekly assignment for grading, compared to only one chance for in-person and blended students. Student satisfaction: Online students were 5 percentage points (down from 63 percent to 58 percent) less satisfied with their course experience than in-person and blended course students. Cost-effectiveness: If institutions opted for a blended instead of in-person model, they could teach 3.4 percent more EM students and 2.5 percent more CMT students at the same price. If the institutions used online instruction, they could teach 18.2 percent more EM students and 15.0 percent more CMT students.", "citations": "", "run_id": "2026-02-24 182618", "scraped_at": "2026-02-24T18:30:52", "hash": "099a81a3bf2468a1c24cd7f1760dba907f6b3cd371a2c2c11d4ad2a6172944a6"}

Researchers conducted a randomized evaluation to test the impact of exposure to and incentives to consume discordant media on political attitudes and behaviors in Turkey.", "policy_issue": "Political polarization can contribute to democratic backsliding and political violence. As polarization increases, citizens may prefer to consume media from outlets that align with their partisan beliefs. In turn, consumers of media outlets displaying partisan bias may be more distrustful of people and media outlets with opposing viewpoints. As a media outlet’s audience becomes increasingly partisan, the outlet faces increasing incentives to produce content with the partisan slant that its consumers want. Exposure to politically discordant or cross-partisan media (i.e., media that does not align with a citizen’s political beliefs) may influence citizens’ political beliefs, attitudes, and participation by exposing individuals to new information and framings of events. However, individuals may not accept information that contrasts with their preexisting beliefs, or individuals may prefer not to expose themselves to discordant media. While previous research suggests that exposure to news media across the political spectrum may not reduce polarization in democracies, less is known about how media contributes to polarization in single-party states, where pro-government media is the primary source of information for citizens.", "context_of_eval": "During the twentieth century, democracy in Turkey was repeatedly interrupted by military coups. Since 2002, the AKP (Justice and Development Party) has been the dominant political party, winning every parliamentary election up to 2022. Since then, international organizations have accused the Turkish government of subjecting journalists to harassment, physical violence, and imprisonment.1 In October 2022, new legislation gave the Turkish government the authority to imprison citizens and journalists for posting disinformation on social media. Since 2002, the AKP has expanded its control of the media, as corporations with close ties to the AKP have acquired major media outlets and altered those outlets’ ideological stances to be more pro-government. Such changes in media ownership, along with newly emerging highly partisan news outlets, have contributed to the dominance of pro-government media in Turkey. Adults were eligible to participate in the study if they lived in Turkey and actively used social media platforms. Seventy percent of participants surveyed in 2021 read the news from pro-government outlets, while 46 percent were classified as having a pro-government political leaning. Sixty percent of those surveyed were male and 87 percent completed at least secondary education. The average age was 28.6 years.", "details_inter": "Researchers conducted a randomized evaluation to test the impact of exposure to and incentives to consume discordant media on political attitudes and behaviors. From February to August 2021, researchers recruited 3,851 adults. All participants downloaded an app onto their phones for data collection and implementation of the intervention. Once a week for seven months, three politically notable headlines from each outlet were flagged for participants as push notifications from the phone app. Based on each participant’s political beliefs, they were randomly assigned to one of five groups: Strongly anti-government (886 participants): Participants in this group followed Gazete Duvar, an online news outlet with a strongly anti-government perspective. Weakly anti-government (455 participants): Participants in this group followed Medyascope, an online video news outlet with a moderately anti-government perspective. Weakly pro-government (402 participants): Participants in this group followed Hürriyet, a newspaper with a moderately pro-government perspective. Strongly pro-government (976 participants): Participants in this group followed Sabah, a newspaper with a strongly pro-government perspective. Comparison (1,132 participants): Participants in this group maintained their usual media consumption. Once a month, participants had the option to complete a quiz testing their memory of information in the previous month’s headlines. Participants received 10 TL ($0.31) for completing a quiz, and an additional 10 TL for correctly answering at least half of the questions. Participants in the comparison group received quizzes on unrelated topics. Participants were never assigned to the group that aligned with their political beliefs (e.g., a person with strongly pro-government beliefs was never assigned to the strongly pro-government group). Some participants were assigned to groups that moderated their political beliefs (e.g., a person with strongly pro-government beliefs may have been assigned to the weakly pro-government group), but this study does not primarily focus on those participants. Researchers surveyed participants four months after they enrolled on their engagement with discordant media, affinity for the AKP, attitudes on democracy, trust towards people with opposing political beliefs, and perceptions of bias in the media. After seven months, researchers surveyed participants again on the same topics.", "results_lessons": "Participants changed their media consumption habits, trusted discordant media sources more, and had less polarized attitudes towards the government, but did not change how much they trusted people with opposing political views. Results from a longer-term follow-up are forthcoming. Discordant media exposure and consumption: Participants in all of the intervention groups were more likely to follow and see posts from media outlets with similar perspectives to the outlets they were assigned to. Moreover, based on data collected from participants who shared their Twitter accounts with researchers, 36 percent of participants continued following their assigned media outlet months after the intervention concluded. On an index measuring how many pro/anti-government outlets participants reported frequently seeking out and preferring to read, participants in the anti-government groups increased their consumption of anti-government news by 0.38 standard deviations, while participants in the pro-government groups increased pro-government media consumption by up to 0.14 standard deviations. Moreover, participants in the weakly pro-government and strongly anti-government groups were less likely to click on anti-government and pro-government news, respectively. Participants in the anti-government groups were 0.16 to 0.22 standard deviations more aware of various anti-government news outlets by the end of the intervention. However, there was no impact on awareness of pro-government media for any of the intervention groups. Political attitudes: By the end of the intervention, the anti- and pro-government groups report less and more affinity for the AKP, respectively. The weakly anti-government group reported being 10 percentage points (from a baseline of 32 percent) less likely to vote for the AKP, while the weakly pro-government group reported being 7 percentage points more likely to vote for the AKP. Participants in the strongly anti- and pro-government groups reported no change in their intentions to vote for the AKP. Meanwhile, the anti-government groups expressed more affinity for opposition parties, but their intended vote for the opposition did not change. The pro-government groups reported no change in affinity towards or intention to vote for opposition parties. During the intervention, the pro-government groups reported feeling more satisfied with democracy in Turkey, although this effect only persisted after the intervention for the strongly pro-government group. Participants in the strongly anti-government group were less favorable of the AKP’s performance on an index of policy issues during the intervention, but there was no effect on perceptions of AKP performance for either anti-government group after the intervention. Although the weakly anti-government group was more likely to express pro-democracy beliefs during the intervention, there was no effect on beliefs about democracy for any of the intervention groups after the intervention ended. Trust in media outlets and people with opposing views: Participants in the pro-government groups reported 0.11 to 0.20 standard deviations more trust in pro-government media relative to the comparison group, while those in the anti-government groups reported 0.18 to 0.25 standard deviations more trust in anti-government media at the end of the intervention. Researchers suggest that participants in the anti-government groups increased their trust in assigned outlets because they learned about a previously unknown source of information, while participants in the pro-government groups increased their trust in pro-government media because they were exposed to a greater breadth of information. Participants also expressed more trust towards others with opposing political views during the intervention. However, the effects on trust disappeared by the end of the intervention. Researchers suggest that achieving lasting reductions in polarization may require more than just exposure to opposing views in media. Overall, exposure to discordant media may be a potential strategy for mitigating political polarization, particularly when targeted at less polarized individuals. Future research could determine if discordant media exposure can have a sustained impact on individual attitudes. The implementer used the research to inform its funding of independent media outlets in Turkey. In particular, based on the finding that the increase in trust in pro-government media appears to be explained by such outlets having broader coverage, the implementer plans to fund independent media to also produce content beyond political news to increase their perceived trustworthiness.", "citations": "Akbiyik, Ahmet, Jeremy Bowles, Horacio Larreguy, and Shelley Liu. “Polarization and Exposure to Counter-Attitudinal Media in a Nondemocracy.” Working paper.

In both the Prosocial and Earnings groups, students received a personalized email and physical letter from the Economics department.

In Nepal, researchers conducted a randomized evaluation of a government teacher training program for math and science teachers to evaluate the impact on student learning in secondary schools. The training program had little or no impact on student learning. Through additional qualitative and quantitative work, researchers identified challenges in the training program’s design, including poor management of training sessions, lack of time and resources to implement new teaching practices, insufficient post-training accountability and support, and a mismatch in the training content difficulty and teachers and students’ ability levels.", "policy_issue": "In low- and middle-income countries, the quality of public services, like education, healthcare, and infrastructure, is often low. Training teachers is a common strategy among policymakers to develop teachers’ pedagogical skills and subject knowledge, with the ultimate goal of improving student learning. However, governments may face challenges in designing and implementing teacher training programs at scale that adequately match the varied skill levels of teachers and the learning needs of students they serve, and that account for the resource constraints within schools to participate in trainings or incorporate new practices. Evaluations of teacher training programs in low- and middle-income countries show mixed results, which is further complicated by the variation in the kinds of training programs being evaluated. With these complications in mind, what are the impacts of an at-scale government teacher training program on student learning?", "context_of_eval": "In Nepal, student learning in government schools is low, particularly for secondary school students: among 9th grade students, more than 20 percent cannot divide six by three and nearly 40 percent cannot calculate the area of a square. Secondary school enrollment rates have been increasing sharply, with enrollment rising from 35 percent in 2008 to 66 percent in 2017, near the start of the evaluation, compounding the challenge of how to improve student learning. Among 9th and 10th grade students in Nepal, 97 percent attend government schools. Secondary school teachers in public schools are required to have three to four years of pre-service training conducted by universities. Trainings conducted during a teacher’s career take place at government regional Educational Training Centers (ETCs). The national School Sector Reform Program (SSRP) ran from 2009-2015 and, in principle, required teachers to attend three ten-day training sessions over five years. However, by 2017, only 31 percent of math teachers and 24 percent of science teachers had received any SSRP training in their subject areas. Evaluations also suggested that the trainings were “too theoretical” and had little impact on teaching practices. Subsequently, the Government of Nepal rolled out a new set of teacher trainings as part of the School Sector Development Program (SSDP)—a plan to improve school quality between 2016 and 2023. Under the SSDP trainings, participants attended ten days of in-person training at ETCs, followed by five days of self-study work focused on developing ten lesson plans and completing subject-specific learning activities that could be incorporated into their teaching plans. Most trainings took place during school days, and teachers received per diems for their days at the ETC. Teachers’ grades for their training participation and project work were to be included in their annual performance reviews. Unlike the SSRP, the government designed the SSDP trainings centrally, focusing on challenging math or science concepts from the 9th and 10th grade curricula and demonstration-based teaching methods with teaching aids made from local materials.", "details_inter": "Researchers partnered with the Government of Nepal to evaluate the impact on student learning of the SSDP trainings for secondary math and science teachers in 203 government schools. Researchers randomly selected sixteen districts from across all seven provinces in Nepal to participate in the study. Researchers then sorted schools within each district into two categories: “priority” schools had no teachers who had completed the prior SSRP training, while “non-priority” schools had at least one SSRP-trained teacher. Within each district, researchers randomly selected about eight schools from the priority group and four from the non-priority group, and assigned half of the selected schools in both groups to receive access to the SSDP teacher training. This resulted in the following groups: Training group: All 9th and 10th grade math and science teachers working at schools assigned to the training group received an invitation to participate in the SSDP teacher training program in late 2017. Most SSDP trainings then ran early in the 2018-2019 school year. Comparison group: Teachers in the comparison group did not receive an invitation to or permission to attend the SSDP training until May 2019, after the evaluation was complete. To measure the impact of the training invitations on student learning, researchers administered two hour-long, in-person math and science assessments to nearly 12,000 9th and 10th grade students across the 203 schools at the end of the 2018-2019 school year. The assessments measured overall math or science achievement and achievement on math or science items most closely tied to content from the SSDP training. Researchers also indirectly tested teacher subject knowledge by asking teachers to provide feedback on what they thought was the correct answer to each question, how well each question aligned with Nepal’s curriculum, and more. The researchers also collected a range of mostly qualitative data, including monitoring data on the training sessions, head teacher and student reports, a phone survey with a subset of trainers and training participants, and a small number of in-depth, in-person interviews with teachers, trainers, and other school actors.", "results_lessons": "Inviting teachers to participate in the SSDP trainings led to little improvement in student learning, and may have reduced learning among the strongest students. Through additional mixed-methods work, researchers identified several potential explanations for this, including low rates of participation by invited teachers, poor management of training sessions, limited time and weak motivation for implementing new teaching practices, and a mismatch between the difficulty of the training content and teachers’ and students’ ability levels. Student test scores: Researchers found no evidence that inviting teachers to participate in the SSDP training program improved student learning. On average, 10th grade students attending schools in the training group received the same math and science assessment scores as students in the comparison group schools, including on assessment questions closely aligned with the SSDP training content. Similarly, 9th graders in the training group received the same or slightly worse assessment scores as students in the comparison group. Teacher participation rates: In the training group, only 61 percent of math teachers and 42 percent of science teachers at the endline survey participated in the SSDP trainings, limiting the potential impact of the program. Many teachers simply did not accept the invitation and attend the training, with only 69 percent of math teachers and 51 percent of science teachers attending the trainings. Reasons for this included that they did not expect to learn much, were preparing for teacher exams, inadequate per diems or accommodations, and/or personal reasons. However, some schools also declined to send their teachers to the training as finding substitutes was difficult. Implementation of SSDP training sessions: Administrative efforts to make sure that trainers had the adequate skills and resources, like information, time, facilities, and materials, were lacking. In addition, trainers stated they had little time or guidance to prepare training content and some ETCs did not have trainers with sufficient math and science expertise. Teacher subject knowledge: The SSDP training did not change teachers’ subject knowledge. Some teachers had weak knowledge of core math or science concepts prior to the training, which may have impeded some teachers from benefitting from the program, particularly training content related to more advanced math and science concepts. Student preparation levels for secondary school: Many students entered 9th and 10th grade with below-grade-level knowledge, which may have been misaligned with the advanced concepts the SSDP training taught teachers to focus on. However, even higher-performing students did not benefit from their teachers’ attending the SSDP training. Teaching practices: Teachers reported insufficient resources and time to prepare and implement lessons, which likely impacted their ability to implement new teaching practices. There was also a lack of accountability for implementing new teaching practices within schools, with teachers reporting little enforcement from school administration. Head teachers and trainers also reported inadequate motivation from teachers. Program costs: SSDP trainings cost about USD$130 per teacher, or USD$2.60 to $3.00 per student. This cost is similar to that of training interventions from other contexts that have been found to be effective in improving student learning. This suggests that the trainings can be improved to be effective, or they could be replaced with interventions that are more cost-effective. This evaluation suggests three broad policy lessons. First, it reveals the challenges governments and teachers may face when designing, implementing, or participating in teacher trainings. Second, improving the governance of public service activities requires not only strengthening accountability, but also ensuring that public servants have adequate time, capacity, and other resources to do their work well. Third, improving public service quality may require not only improvements in governance, but also improved tailoring of policy design to context. While the implementing partner did not directly use the evaluation results, these findings have shaped governmental decisions aimed at enhancing educational quality. The study’s impact is evidenced by the government’s subsequent willingness to authorize another randomized controlled trial, this one focused on phone-based tutoring, when prompted by one of the researchers. Furthermore, the study provided a rigorous assessment of secondary students’ learning levels, corroborating the broadly acknowledged concern about their deficiencies. Both the Ministry of Education and various development partners have since underscored the issue of low learning levels, drawing from the insights provided by this research.", "citations": "Schaffner, Julie, Paul Glewwe, and Uttam Sharma. “Why Programs Fail: Lessons for Improving Public Service Quality from a Mixed-Methods Evaluation of an Unsuccessful Teacher Training Program in Nepal.” Working paper.

However, if people living with HIV do not have the means to take the medicine as instructed, ART may not work as effectively—patients can develop resistance to the medicine, the disease can get worse, and patients may die. Taking ART as directed can also be more cost-effective than resorting to the rarer, more expensive drugs that are prescribed when the first treatment plan fails. People living with HIV in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) typically adhere to ART, but there is some evidence from sub-Saharan Africa that as time passes, patients do not keep up their medication regimen as regularly as they did at the beginning. In LMICs, barriers to taking ART as intended include distance from the health clinic or pharmacy and unaffordable medication. Cell phone reminders in high-income countries help people follow their antiretroviral regimens and manage other chronic diseases, but research on such reminders in LMICs is limited. In one study in Kenya, alarm clock reminders helped women take non-ART medicines. Can mobile phone reminders encourage antiretroviral adherence in LMICs, many of which have a high rate of cell phone coverage?", "context_of_eval": "This evaluation took place in Kenya’s Nyanza Province at Chulaimbo Rural Health Center (CRHC), which started operations in 2005. CRHC is a government health center that runs an HIV/AIDS clinic administered by the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare (AMPATH). According to the 2007 Kenya AIDS Indicator Survey (KAIS) and the 2003 and 2008-2009 Kenya Demographic and Health Surveys, 6.3 to 7.4 percent of Kenyan adults were living with HIV. In Nyanza, the 2007 KAIS showed an HIV prevalence rate of 17.95 percent among adults aged 35 years old and over (the study’s population of interest).1 Forty-five percent of the participants in the study had a cell phone and 97 percent lived in areas covered by mobile phone networks. The participants mostly took the antiretrovirals lamivudine, nevirapine, and zidovudine. The participants were, on average, 36 years old, 66 percent women, and a little under 23 percent completed high school.", "details_inter": "Researchers conducted a randomized evaluation to test the impact of text message reminders on ART adherence. CRHC patients were given cell phones to use as they liked. They were directed to a participating pharmacy and provided medication (mostly lamivudine) in bottles with electronic caps to measure how many times they opened their bottles. Research staff used a random number generator to randomly assign 428 CRHC patients to one of five groups: Weekly long texts (74 patients): Patients in this group were sent long text message reminders to take their medications along with additional encouragement every week. Weekly short texts (73 patients): Patients were sent brief text message reminders to take their medications every week. Daily long texts (72 patients): Patients were sent a long text message reminder every day. Daily short texts (70 patients): Patients were sent a brief text message reminder every day. Comparison Group (139 patients): Patients in this group were not sent text messages. The text of the four message categories was designed with health center employees. Brief messages simply reminded people to take their medicine, whereas longer messages provided additional encouragement. Daily texts were timed to match when patients were supposed to take their medicine. Patients were required by AMPATH to visit the health center once a month where their phones were examined and their medication bottles scanned. The enrollment and intervention took place between June 2007 and December 2008. The main outcome of interest was ART adherence or whether a patient had taken their medication at least 90 percent of the time over the course of a 12-week period. A second outcome of interest was treatment interruption or whether the time between two consecutive openings of a patient’s medication bottle exceeded 48 hours. In addition to receiving ethical review and approvals from an institutional review board, researchers made efforts to address and account for ethical questions by ensuring: All messages were less than 160 characters and did not specify HIV or ART in order to maintain confidentiality of HIV status. Participants were asked to specify their preferred language. All participants gave informed consent to participation in the study. Eligible patients were informed about the study and then asked for consent in one of three languages (English, Dholuo, and Kiswahili). However, due to the customary use of mobile phones by more than one individual in some settings, cell phone interventions will need to continue to address issues of confidentiality. For more on the researchers’ discussion of ethical considerations, see here on pages 826, 827, and 832.", "results_lessons": "Weekly text message reminders were more effective than daily reminders at getting people to take ART as prescribed more often and to reduce skipped doses. Taking medicine as prescribed 90 percent of the time: Over the course of 48 weeks, patients in who got weekly text message reminders were 13 percentage points more likely to take their medicine 90 percent of the time, in contrast with 40 percent of patients in the comparison group (a 32.5 percent increase). Daily messages did not change ART adherence. Researchers suggest that participants may have gotten used to and started to ignore the daily messages. Additionally, neither short nor long text reminders had any impact on adherence. Not skipping doses for 2 or more days: Over the course of 48 weeks, patients in the group that got weekly text messages were 9 percentage points less likely to have skipped doses for at least two full days, compared to 90 percent of patients in the comparison group (a 10 percent decrease). Additionally, patients who received long messages were 7 percentage points less likely to have skipped doses for at least two days, compared to 90 percent of in the comparison group (a 7.8 percent decrease). Daily messages and short messages did not change dose skipping behavior. Taken together, these results suggest that texts can help people living with HIV in LMICs to take ART as prescribed 90 percent of the time and to stop skipping doses for two days or more. Text message interventions (e.g., medication reminders and monitoring, nudges about doctors’ visits, keeping track of adverse reactions to medication, etc.) could cost-effectively reach many people living with HIV, but more research is needed to explore how to best tailor text messages to change medication-taking behavior.", "citations": "", "run_id": "2026-02-24 182618", "scraped_at": "2026-02-24T18:30:52", "hash": "2e58a423b02200b866f0ed28d57b34e1ab21ba5b79c8bf98917d2221802ffa71"}

In HIV-endemic contexts, testing for HIV regularly may suggest that partners are safe, but can also suggest that the test seeker has been involved in risky sexual behavior. As a result, people may choose to delay marriage at a higher rate in these contexts, as it takes time to discover if a prospective partner is safe given that HIV status and risky behaviors are hard to perceive. Can providing regular HIV testing allow potential partners to better identify sexual partners and change marriage and pregnancy timing?", "context_of_eval": "In Malawi, HIV prevalence was 10.6 percent in 2010 and considered a public health priority. HIV risk is thus a common consideration when choosing a partner or determining a partner’s safety for individuals seeking marriage. In this setting, individuals typically choose when and whom to marry, as polygamy and marriage payments are uncommon. In the Balaka District, where this intervention takes place, HIV testing was low in 2009 despite risk of contraction. Fourteen percent of women without children had tested in the last four months and 35 percent reported ever being tested. Individuals noted potential barriers to testing such as cost, time spent seeking care, and stigma. In an adjacent district, patients spent 7.1 hours per visit seeking HIV care, on average. As a result, policymakers started offering provider-led HIV testing and counseling in 2005. Healthcare providers offered optional HIV testing when patients attended routine healthcare appointments. At the time of the study, 89 percent of mothers reported being tested at antenatal clinics that offered HIV testing. The incidence of first marriage and first birth in Malawi roughly followed the peak of HIV prevalence, which was 14 percent in 1998, and subsequent decline to 10.6 percent in 2010, pointing to a positive relationship between the decision to get married at a younger age and HIV incidence. Prior to the study, 42 percent of participants were married and 71 percent of pregnancies in the study sample happened within marriage. Similarly, 85 percent of unmarried participants qualified as sexually safe when asked about engagement in risky sexual behavior. The estimated HIV prevalence among participants ranged between 7 percent for those determined sexually safe and 23 percent for those determined unsafe. Physical appearance was also considered a relevant observable aspect for women looking for a partner in this setting. Prior to the intervention, 45 percent of participants were considered of average physical attractiveness, while 45 percent were reported to be more attractive than average.", "details_inter": "Researchers conducted a randomized evaluation to test the impact of offering high-frequency HIV testing on marriage and pregnancy in Balaka, Malawi. The evaluation was part of the Tsogolo La Thanzi (TLT) Panel Study, which surveyed 1,505 women aged 15 to 25 eight times over 28 months. Participants were assigned to one of three groups: Multiple-test group (500 participants): Surveyors offered a free HIV test following all eight waves of surveys to participants in this group. Single-test group (498 participants): Surveyors offered a free HIV test after both survey wave four and eight to participants in this group. Comparison group (507 participants): Surveyors offered a free HIV test after survey wave eight to participants in this group. Enumerators also encouraged participants to invite their partners to join the study, allowing researchers to observe if those in the intervention group would identify partners based on their willingness to engage and test themselves. The intervention aimed to reduce the inconvenience and stigma of HIV testing by offering an opt-out approach. After completing the survey for the dataset, surveyors offered HIV tests that provided results within 30 minutes. To ensure confidentiality, enumerators delivered test results verbally and in private. However, other individuals could indirectly notice the testing behavior and results, such as through inferring visit duration. If a participant tested positive, surveyors stopped testing and delivered antiretroviral medication, suggesting subsequent HIV testing indirectly showed HIV status in prior waves. Surveyors collected participant HIV data over eight rounds of surveys, which occurred every four months from 2009 to 2011 at the TLT clinic. Participants received US$3 upon completing each survey.

These results suggest that frequent testing gave participants the information necessary to identify sexually safe partners, while offering a single-test HIV test did not have any impacts. Frequency of HIV testing: Receiving high-frequency HIV testing increased the probability of testing for HIV within four months by 40 percentage points relative to the comparison group average of 30 percent (a 133 percent increase). Similarly, participants’ partners were 15 percentage points more likely to test for HIV within four months relative to the comparison group average of 30 percent (an 83 percent increase). Researchers suggest that high-frequency HIV testing decreased the individual costs associated with testing. Beliefs about partners HIV risk: Women in the intervention group were more likely to perceive their partners were HIV-negative if they were consistently tested. On the other hand, women were more likely to perceive greater HIV risk if their partners tested zero times or once. Marriage and pregnancy: Receiving frequent HIV tests increased the probability of marriage among unmarried participants by 7.2 percentage points relative to the comparison group average of 16 percent (a 45 percent increase). There were no impacts for women married before the intervention, suggesting the intervention did not prompt divorce. Receiving frequent HIV tests also increased the probability of pregnancy among unmarried participants by 3.5 percentage points relative to the comparison group average of 10 percent (a 35 percent increase). Greater impacts for sexually safe women: High-frequency HIV testing increased the likelihood of marriage by 7.1 percentage points among sexually safe, previously unmarried women relative to the comparison group average of 14 percent (a 51 percent increase). Similarly, there was an increase in pregnancy by 3.9 percentage points relative to the comparison group average of 9 percent (a 43 percent increase) among the same group. Researchers suggest that frequent HIV testing allowed participants to better identify safe partners, which led to accelerated marriage and improvements in quality of matches. Greater impacts for physically attractive women: Among sexually safe, unmarried women, frequent HIV testing increased the probability of marriage by 11 percentage points (a 92 percent increase) and increased the probability of pregnancy by 5.1 percentage points (a 64 percent increase) for attractive women. Researchers suggest that participants valued physical appearance when choosing a partner. Availability of regular HIV testing: Offering a single HIV test did not impact marriage or pregnancy, suggesting that single-testing revealed less information about potential partners compared to frequent testing, which allowed individuals to better identify partners. Researchers note that these results should be taken with caution, as there may be unintended consequences from early marriage and pregnancy.

The curriculum is intended to develop soft skills such as emotional regulation, teamwork, and communication. It features two main components: a happiness class and guided mindfulness meditation. The happiness class takes place in the first half hour of each school day, beginning with a short, guided meditation followed by a group activity (such as storytelling and reflection), class discussion, and a final mindfulness session. Once a week, a longer guided mindfulness meditation session takes the place of the 30-minute happiness class.

Paying for college is a major factor that influences low-income students’ decisions to pursue higher education.3 In recent decades, the cost of attending a four-year public college has risen substantially,4 in part due to large state funding cuts.5 While federal student aid has also increased, it often still falls short of covering the increases in tuition for all students in need. Informational barriers and complexities within the financial aid system may compound cost concerns, preventing high-achieving, low-income students from attending schools that would improve their life outcomes. The typical financial aid process requires students to annually verify need through complicated forms and does not inform students of their aid amount until after they have applied to and been accepted to a college. Free tuition programs are a popular solution to increase college enrollment for low-income students. Some of these programs set tuition to zero for all students, while others target free tuition on students who have demonstrated need through the traditional aid system. However, there is little evidence on which program design is more effective. Does including a high degree of certainty in free tuition offers have an impact on application to and enrollment in college?", "context_of_eval": "Overall, 12 percent of college students come from the bottom fifth of the family-income distribution while 28 percent are from the top fifth.6 At selective colleges, there are more students from the top one percent of the income distribution than from the entire bottom half.

The school received 64,972 applications for first-year undergraduate admissions for the fall of 2019 and admitted 14,883, a 23 percent acceptance rate.7 In the 2019 U.S. News & World Report, University of Michigan at Ann Arbor ranked 25th in the country, making it the third highest ranked public university.8 Starting in 2015, the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor offered thousands of low-income students an up-front guarantee of four years of free tuition and fees through their “HAIL Scholarship.” The scholarship was offered to students in the fall of their senior year of high school, before college application deadlines, and did not require any paperwork or verification after admission. Since 2017, the University has also offered the “Go Blue Guarantee,” which provides free tuition and fees to admitted students who have shown that their family’s income and assets fall below given cutoffs. In 2017 the cutoffs were US$65,000 for income and US$50,000 for assets.9 Using data from the Michigan Center for Educational Performance and Information, researchers identified high-achieving high school students in the state who would be competitive applicants for UM.

In fall 2019, 1,796 high-achieving low-income high school seniors in Michigan were randomly assigned to receive a HAIL scholarship offer, personalized outreach about the Go Blue Guarantee, or business-as-usual recruiting communications from UM. Randomization occurred at the school level: all eligible students in a given school were assigned the same treatment. Researchers used stratified randomization to ensure that the three groups had a roughly equal number of schools by region and urbanicity (i.e., city, suburb, town, or rural). The groups and the mailings were as follows: Comparison (610 students at 159 schools): recruitment materials typically sent to prospective applicants general information about financial aid HAIL Scholarship (595 students at 159 schools): Students and their parents received: a personalized encouragement to apply from the university president an unconditional offer of four years of free tuition and fees Go Blue Encouragement (591 students at 159 schools): Students and their parents received: a personalized encouragement to apply from the university president information about the Go Blue Guarantee, which provides up to four years of free tuition and fees for those whose eligibility has been verified through annual financial aid applications. Though both intervention groups emphasized free tuition, they differed in how much certainty they provided to students. One offered a four-year guarantee of free tuition, with no application required. The other described a program the student might be eligible for, were they to demonstrate need through an aid application. Application to the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and enrollment at any college in the US were the primary outcomes of interest. Data on the outcome variables was collected from the university, the state of Michigan, and the National Student Clearinghouse.", "results_lessons": "The HAIL Scholarship substantially increased application and enrollment rates. The Go Blue Encouragement had a smaller but significant effect on application but zero effect on enrollment. Primary Outcomes Applications The HAIL Scholarship increased application rates by 28 percentage points from a baseline of 35 percent (an 80 percent increase). The Go Blue Encouragement increased application rates by 8 percentage points from a baseline of 35 percent (a 23 percent increase). Enrollment The HAIL Scholarship increased enrollment by 9 percentage points from a baseline of 17 percent (a 53 percent increase). Enrollment data from the National Student Clearinghouse shows that students who received the HAIL Scholarship were diverted from community colleges and less selective four-year colleges; none were diverted from schools as selective as University of Michigan. The Go Blue Encouragement had no impact on enrollment. The positive effects of the Go Blue Encouragement on application suggest that a lack of information may have been preventing low-income, high-achieving students from applying to a selective school like UM. The findings on enrollment, combined with minimal differences in actual financial aid received, suggest that students place a high value on financial certainty when making schooling decisions. Straightforward zero-tuition programs like the HAIL Scholarship may increase enrollment of low-income students at four-year colleges more than conditional programs like the Go Blue Encouragement. Policymakers aiming to target high-achieving, low-income students should consider programs that proactively identify eligible students using administrative data and inform students early of their eligibility, rather than requiring students to apply via the traditional aid system. Use of Results Inspired by the HAIL program, in 2024 the state of Washington, passed legislation that automatically awards tuition grants to students who received food assistance through SNAP while they were in high school.10 Over eight years, HAIL was gradually expanded to include every public high school in the state of Michigan.

The US Department of Health and Human Services’ goal is to have eighty percent of new ESKD patients participate in home dialysis or receive a kidney transplant by 2025. The relatively low proportion of home dialysis rates could be, in part, due to financial incentives for Medicare managing clinicians and ESKD facilities that encourage facility-based treatment. This raises the question of whether financial incentives and payment reforms for ESKD managing clinicians and facilities can increase home dialysis rates.", "context_of_eval": "In the United States, Medicare is the federal health insurance program available to people over 65 years old, people younger than 65 who have certain disabilities, and people of any age who have end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). ESKD is the permanent failure of the kidneys that requires dialysis or a kidney transplant. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI)–a government agency created by Congress in 2010–designed and implemented a new payment model—the End Stage Renal Disease Treatment Choice (ETC) model—meant to incentivize home dialysis for ESKD facilities and managing clinicians. Medicare sets the amount at which Medicare providers are reimbursed, so financial incentives may influence the treatment provided. The ETC program began on January 1, 2021, and its last measurement period ends on June 30, 2026. There are two types of incentives in the program: the Home Dialysis Payment Adjustment (HDPA) and the Performance Payment Adjustment (PPA). HDPA increases reimbursements for home dialysis. PPA increases or decreases reimbursement rates based on whether a facility meets target thresholds for home dialysis and transplant rates. In 2021, HDPA increased reimbursement by 3 percent and PPA changed reimbursement by -5 percent to +4 percent. Patients in the evaluation were at least 66 years old and initiated treatment in dialysis in 2021. 18,621 patients were eligible for the study in hospital referral regions throughout the United States. The average patient was 75 years old. Most (83 percent) lived in an urban area. Sixty-six percent of patients were white, 58 percent were male, and 18 percent had a disability. Additionally, 25 percent received Medicaid coverage, the government health insurance assistance for which people with low incomes of all ages qualify.", "details_inter": "CMMI randomly assigned 30 percent of hospital referral regions (HRRs) to participate in the ETC model. Participation was mandatory, with all providers in participating HRRs receiving adjusted payments for dialysis treatment based on ETC. Assignment was determined by stratified randomization of US census regions, which are Northeast, South, Midwest, and West (i.e., within each census region, 30 percent of HRRs were randomly selected for the payment reform model). The researchers explored if the ETC model increased home dialysis rates during the first year of the program, 2021. Their primary outcome of interest was the percent of patients initiating dialysis who received any home dialysis during the first 90 days of their treatment, measured using comprehensive claims data.", "results_lessons": "During the first year of the new payment model, there was no statistically significant difference between participating HRRs and comparison HRRs in the share of patients receiving any home dialysis during the first ninety days of their treatment. The same was true when researchers examined subsamples by various patient and facility characteristics, such as a patient’s distance to the nearest facility and whether or not the facility was a chain. In the comparison group, 20.6 percent of the new patients received home dialysis during their first 90 days of treatment; in the treatment group, this share was 0.12 percentage points higher, a statistically nonsignificant difference. It is possible the lack of impact on home dialysis rates could change in later years of the program, when the size of financial incentives becomes larger. However, provider payment incentives of equal or lesser magnitude in other health care settings have produced statistically significant changes in provider behavior. This raises questions about the efficacy of the ETC model for increasing home dialysis among Medicare ESKD patients. Research on future years of the intervention will help further reveal whether or not ETC is an effective model for increasing home dialysis rates.", "citations": "Ji, Yunan, Liran Einav, Neale Mahoney, and Amy Finkelstein. \"Financial incentives to facilities and clinicians treating patients with end-stage kidney disease and use of home dialysis: a randomized clinical trial.\" In JAMA Health Forum, vol. 3, no. 10, pp. e223503-e223503.

The information campaign led farmers to change their beliefs about the quality of fertilizer available in local markets and to buy more fertilizer.", "policy_issue": "Small-scale farmers in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa often do not use inputs like fertilizer to increase their productivity despite evidence suggesting their effectiveness. There are a variety of reasons why small-scale farmers do not adopt or under-adopt fertilizer, including limited access to agricultural input markets, the high cost of fertilizer, barriers to credit access, and limited information about its benefits and how to apply it effectively.1 An additional factor that often limits farmers’ purchase of fertilizer is a lack of trust in the quality of fertilizer available in local markets. Farmers purchase fertilizers and other inputs from agro-dealers who operate small stores in often unregulated markets. Due to this perceived lack of regulation and since fertilizer quality is not visually apparent, farmers have low levels of trust in agricultural markets, which limits farmers’ willingness to make input purchases. As a result, farmers’ productivity may be sub-optimal and negatively affect their livelihoods. Providing farmers with information about productive inputs like fertilizer is a common policy in many low- and middle-income countries. Information is primarily provided through extension services managed by ministries of agriculture. However, extension services generally provide information about the benefits and use of productive inputs rather than the quality of inputs available in local markets. Can providing both farmers and agro-dealers with information about the quality of fertilizer from their markets improve trust and lead more farmers to purchase and use fertilizer?", "context_of_eval": "Agricultural productivity in Tanzania is limited in part due to low fertilizer use. Small-scale farmers in Tanzania use between 15 and 20 kilograms of fertilizer per hectare, well below the government’s recommended amount. Fertilizer is available for purchase in local markets from agro-dealers. Agro-dealers mainly source fertilizer from wholesalers who buy imported fertilizer from the Dar es Salaam port. The Tanzania Fertilizer Regulatory Authority (TFRA) regulates the quality of fertilizer; however, the agency is underfunded and does not have the capacity to carry out widespread testing. Eighty percent of farmers surveyed in the study believed that the fertilizer available in local markets is of low quality, a belief that is reinforced in local media. However, research has proven some common perceptions are inaccurate. Previous research2 tested the quality of fertilizer available in local markets in Tanzania and found that less than 1 percent of fertilizer samples had low quality. Small-scale agriculture accounts for 80 to 90 percent of economic activity in Morogoro, an agricultural region of eastern Tanzania where this evaluation took place. In Morogoro, small-scale farmers primarily cultivated maize. Sixty percent of farmers in the study area were male, with an average age of 45, and with families of five to six members. They owned on average seven acres of land, and 37 percent of farmers reported having purchased fertilizer in the last season. Most agro-dealers in the study were also male, had at least secondary education, and had been operating their shops for over four years. Only about half of the shops had the required government TFRA license to sell fertilizer.", "details_inter": "In partnership with Tanzania’s Sokoine University of Agriculture (SUA), a well-trusted, public university, researchers conducted an evaluation to test the impact of an information campaign about the quality of fertilizer available in local markets on farmers’ beliefs about quality and their purchase and use of fertilizer. Researchers randomly assigned half of the 100 markets in the Morogoro agricultural region of Tanzania to receive pamphlets and posters with information that the fertilizer tested in that market was of high quality. The other 50 markets did not receive any pamphlets. Additionally, researchers assigned 74 villages close to the markets that were selected to receive the information campaign to also receive the intervention. In these villages, in-person meetings were held to share information about the high quality of fertilizer available in their local markets. These meeting reflected traditional extension services with an emphasis on fertilizer quality and allowed farmers to ask questions about the quality testing. The other 74 villages near Morogoro’s markets did not receive in-person meetings. Researchers carried out both the market-level and village-level components of the intervention between December 2018 and January 2019. To measure whether the market and village information campaigns had an impact on farmers’ belief about the quality of fertilizer and subsequent purchase, researchers collected data through surveys of farmers and agro-dealers both before and nine to twelve months after the intervention. Researchers surveyed farmers in-person to collect information on beliefs of fertilizer quality, fertilizer purchase and use, as well as maize production. They also surveyed agro-dealers to understand shop and owner characteristics, inventory, and fertilizer sales. In addition to receiving ethical review and approvals from an institutional review board, researchers made efforts to address and account for ethical questions by inviting all farmers from the comparison group in the village to a common location and conducting the information meetings after the completion of the study so not to exclude any farmers form receiving information. For more on the researchers’ discussion of ethical considerations, see the ethics appendix starting on page 84 of the working paper.", "results_lessons": "The information campaign led farmers to change their beliefs about the quality of fertilizer available in local markets and led more farmers to buy fertilizer. Agro-dealers sold more fertilizer, but fertilizer prices did not increase as a result of the information campaign. Beliefs about Fertilizer Quality: Partaking in the village information sessions reduced the probability that farmers had any concern about the quality of fertilizer by 10.5 percentage points from a base of 80 percent (a 12 percent decrease). Fifty percent of farmers who received the information campaign still reported concerns of fertilizer quality demonstrating that while many farmers changed their views, some farmers in each village continued to believe the available fertilizer is low quality. Fertilizer Purchase and Use: Farmers who participated in the village information sessions were 10 percentage points more likely to purchase fertilizer compared to those who did not receive the information campaign (a 27 percent increase). Researchers posit the increase is largely driven by farmers buying fertilizer for the first time, since participation in the information sessions did not significantly increase the amount of fertilizer that farmers purchased. The information campaign also persuaded farmers to use more fertilizer. Farmers who participated in the information sessions used 5.6 kg more fertilizer per acre from a base of 11.988 kg per acre (a 46 percent increase). Maize Yields: Providing farmers with information on fertilizer quality did not lead to higher maize yields. Researchers explain this is expected as the potential impact on yields may take multiple agricultural seasons. Price and Quantity of Fertilizer Sold: The information campaign did not affect the market price of fertilizer, which is to be expected as fertilizer prices are controlled by the government in Tanzania. The information campaign increased the amount of fertilizer agro-dealers sold in local markets, but only when a fat-tailed data econometric method was applied.", "citations": "", "run_id": "2026-02-24 182618", "scraped_at": "2026-02-24T18:30:52", "hash": "26020ec00bc9c42c12b69a4d22818b2a90af2ad02a6be541ae43fffdede515b9"}

Households consumed enough food both before and after receiving the cash transfer. Household members also did not sell valuables, their mental health and analytical skills did not suffer, and they did not work much longer hours.", "policy_issue": "Theoretically and in practice, temporary and expected changes in cash on hand should not affect what people buy. Yet impulsive purchases and a less than perfect financial market may impact people’s consumption choices when they experience a change in income. Changes in income can be costly to households. Households want to meet their current needs, which could mean foregoing long-term investments, like paying for children’s schooling, keeping instead of selling productive resources, or avoiding risky but rewarding investments. Unsteady income and the decisions made to stabilize it can be stressful, both psychologically and cognitively. This stress might change the actions of those experiencing financial poverty and affect their mental health, partially preventing them recovering or adjusting. The stress and mental health issues that come with experiencing periods of financial uncertainty could lead to risky situations and choices, or not protecting assets and health. Did Mexico’s cash transfer program, PROSPERA, help households living in poverty maintain food consumption, especially near the time the transfers were deposited?", "context_of_eval": "Mexico’s PROSPERA (1998-2019) was a well-known and extensive cash transfer project. Families living near or below Mexico’s poverty line (Línea de Bienestar Mínimo) were eligible for transfers if they sent their children (i.e., those younger than 12 years old) to schools and health clinics. Mexico’s poverty line is defined as the amount of money needed to buy basic foodstuffs. The Mexican government did not want people’s circumstances to hurt their nutrition, health, and education needs. [1] The program benefited 28 million people and 6.8 million households, about a quarter of Mexico’s families. Cash transfer recipients received the deposit once every two months and they knew when the cash would be deposited. The deposit dates were different for various participants. PROSPERA sent funds to beneficiaries’ savings accounts, which came with debit cards. On average, participants in this study received US$79 per PROSPERA deposit, or MX$1,604 in 2022. The money from PROSPERA was, on average, 13 percent of participants’ yearly income. In 2020, Mexico’s level of financial inclusion, or the 36.9 percent of Mexicans who have bank accounts, was much lower than other countries in Latin America. Inconsistent or low income is a reason people do not open bank accounts in Mexico. [2] Debit card purchases and withdrawals among PROSPERA participants was low: 67 percent of participants made just one withdrawal every two months.[3] Participants in the study were about 43 years old with just over six and a half years of schooling, on average. The majority of participants were women. Not including PROSPERA transfers, households’ average weekly income was MXN$1460 (US$72 in 2022). PROSPERA recipients lived about 6.2 kilometers from the closest bank.", "details_inter": "Researchers conducted a randomized evaluation to test the impact of PROSPERA on the food consumption of Mexican households living in poverty. Interviews took place in early 2016. The researchers conducted the study in Distrito Federal, Hidalgo, Estado de México, Michoacán, Morelos, and Veracruz. They looked at the effects of PROSPERA in 52 localities on the outskirts of urban centers. A sample of 3,534 households were randomly divided into four groups that were interviewed either before or after the PROSPERA deposit: Eight to five days before (888 of participants from sample): 25.13 percent of households were interviewed eight to five days prior to the transfer. Four to one days before (887 of participants from sample): 25.1 percent of households were interviewed four to one days prior to the transfer. Day of to three days after (885 of participants from sample): 25.04 percent of households were interviewed the day of or three days after the transfer. Four to seven days after (874 of participants from sample): 24.73 percent of households were interviewed four to seven days post-transfer. Randomly interviewing households either before or after the PROSPERA deposit showed the change in how much food they bought based on when they were paid. The random interviews and the various pay dates ensured that households in the four groups were similar. In the survey, to measure food consumption, the interviewers asked households about what they ate yesterday and the quantity and value of that food. The interviewers also gathered information about the households’ jobs, wages, financial state, sale of assets, emotional wellbeing, healthy practices, cognitive status, and tolerance for risk.", "results_lessons": "Food consumption did not change before or after the PROSPERA transfer, as households did not run out of money for food. Food consumption: Households did not change how much food they ate either before or after receiving the PROSPERA deposit. Households that were more dependent on PROSPERA (i.e., if the transfer made up more than 20 percent of their annual income) did not show different results than families that were less dependent on PROSPERA. Savings, sales of assets, and income from work: Households about to receive their PROSPERA transfer did not use savings, sell property, or work a lot of extra hours, as they may have seen the money as extra but not essential income. Mental, cognitive, and physical health: Households that did not receive a transfer for about two months did not see a reduction in their cognitive abilities, healthy behavior, or physical and mental soundness. Healthy habits and risk intolerance increased by 0.06 and 0.07 standard deviations, which is significant at the 10 percent level, and there was a boost in mental health. Researchers suggest that because households were looking forward to the transfer, they also saw a small boost in their mental health and healthy habits. Lack of available cash: Along with some households’ distance from banks, newness to debit cards, and the charges for making multiple withdrawals, PROSPERA deposits into bank accounts made the money harder to access as opposed to cash, which may have helped households practice restraint. In certain contexts, households may better balance their spending if their deposits are less accessible (i.e., in a bank account that takes a bit of a commute to get to). The way transfers are delivered, specifically in the form of deposits into bank accounts, can help people who both have changing preferences and who are new to formal financial tools.", "citations": "", "run_id": "2026-02-24 182618", "scraped_at": "2026-02-24T18:30:52", "hash": "2d1f8b1010fc68a0030346e51802112bee0f2ee0c90697ebfd90344b13aa03cc"}

As a result, identifying policies to alleviate poverty in these settings is crucial. Socioeconomic constraints such as low levels of education, lack of employment opportunities, exposure to uninsured risks, and the psychological stress of poverty exacerbate the precarity of those living in extreme poverty; many people face multiple constraints simultaneously. When put together, these constraints give rise to poverty traps that prevent individuals from escaping poverty even if one is alleviated. These challenges are compounded in countries affected by conflict, violence, and weak institutions. Multi-faceted big-push interventions – known as the Targeting the Ultra Poor program or Graduation Approach – are meant to alleviate multiple constraints concurrently and show promise as an avenue for poverty reduction. The program—first designed and implemented by BRAC in Bangladesh— offers a time-limited package of productive assets, access to savings accounts, cash stipends, skill training, coaching, and additional complementary supports to lift households out of poverty sustainably. Multiple studies have shown these programs to be effective in stable contexts, but there is limited evidence of their effectiveness in fragile- and conflict-affected settings. Can big-push interventions effectively reduce poverty in fragile and conflict-affected settings?", "context_of_eval": "Afghanistan, a country that has faced over three decades of civil conflict, is among the world's most economically challenged and fragile nations. From 2011 to 2016, the proportion of the population living below the national poverty line increased from 38 percent to 55 percent. In the ultra-poor households that were targeted in this study, five out of six households had an illiterate household head, two-thirds were in debt, and 1.5 percent had savings. Four percent of women could read and write, two out of three were depressed, and women’s labor force participation remained low while underemployment was high. This project was implemented from 2015 to 2018 under the World Bank’s Access to Finance program by the Microfinance Investment Support Facility for Afghanistan (MISFA), an independent apex organization. It reached a total of 7,500 households over six provinces in Afghanistan.", "details_inter": "Researchers partnered with local NGOs to conduct a randomized evaluation to test the impact of a Graduation-style intervention on poverty reduction. This study focused on ultra-poor households from the Dehdadi, Dawlatabad, Nah-e Shahi, and Khulm districts in the Balkh province of Afghanistan. Similar to BRAC's original Graduation Approach design, the program targeted women as beneficiaries of the big-push package. A local NGO, Coordination for Humanitarian Assistance, facilitated a community process to identify the poorest households in each village for the program. Eligibility criteria—such as household dependency on women’s domestic work or begging, no male income earners in the household, and school-age children working for pay—were used to identify the most vulnerable households within those selected through the community process. From this selection process, 1,219 households across 80 villages were included in the study and divided into two groups. 491 households received the intervention package, which included livestock (worth approximately US$309-$405 of cows or goats), a monthly cash transfer of US$15, training on livestock rearing and entrepreneurship, a health subsidy worth US$22, and regular mentoring visits. 728 households were part of the comparison group, which did not receive any intervention. In May 2016, participants received the asset transfer and began receiving other program components, which lasted 12 months. From July to October 2018—one year after the end of the program and two years after the initial asset transfer— researchers conducted a follow-up survey. Surveys primarily measured consumption, assets, financial inclusion, psychological well-being, and women’s empowerment, as well as school enrollment, absenteeism, and health.", "results_lessons": "Two years after the initial asset transfers, the Graduation program had large and positive impacts on consumption and various measures of household members’ well-being. These effects were driven by an increase in total time spent working by women heads of household. Consumption, food security, and finance: Monthly per-capita consumption increased by US$24, a 30 percent increase relative to the comparison group's mean of US$81. This directly led to a decrease of 20 percentage points in the share of households below the national poverty line, from a base of 82 percent. Food security also increased: the likelihood that all household members were regularly eating at least two meals a day increased by 11 percentage points, from a base of 76 percent in the comparison group. Graduation households also saw an increase in financial inclusion. Savings-related behavior improved: program households became 28 percentage points more likely to have a bank account, from a base of two percent in the comparison group. Savings amounts increased by US$106 relative to the comparison group’s US$5. Households that received the package were 12 percentage points more likely (from a base of 2 percent) to say they could access formal credit. They were 14 percentage points less likely to have an outstanding loan, on a base of 55 percent in the comparison group, attributable to a decrease in the use of consumption loans. Income, revenues, and assets: Participants’ total monthly income and revenue increased by 22 percent against the mean of US$307 in the comparison group. This is primarily due to an increase in revenues in the last four weeks from livestock activities, which equated to 281 percent (from a base of US$22). Program recipients saw large gains in durable and productive assets one year after the activities ended. The average livestock value remained 315 percent higher than the comparison group (from a base of US$72), though lower than the original value of the transfer. Further, participants held more higher-return productive assets in the form of cows, sheep, and goats. Time use and labor supply: In intervention households, women increased their total time spent working by 55 percent, from a base of 4.2 full-time days per month in the comparison group, translating to an additional 2.3 full-time days per month. Large increases in time spent on livestock rearing and reductions in other paid work suggest that women shifted their time from less to more profitable activities. Moreover, the share of women’s labor participation—measured as market work, self-employment, or job searching— increased by 22 percentage points, from 35 percent in the comparison group. These findings suggest that the program created economic opportunity for under-employed women in a context with low female labor force participation. Women’s empowerment: The Graduation program improved some measures of women’s empowerment. Women in the program reported increased participation in decisions about their own bodies and time, participation in income-generating activities, and political and community involvement. Household finances and expenditures did not improve, but researchers suggest this may be due to the fact that women in the study were already doing well in these areas. Psychological well-being: Graduation households saw large positive gains across measures of psychological well-being of both men and women heads of households. Child health and education: Relative to the control group, Graduation households saw a reduction in diarrhea for the oldest child under five, an increase in school enrollment, and a reduction in absenteeism.

Depression and economic decision-making are negatively associated, but there is limited evidence to support a causal link between them. The symptoms of depression, like sadness and loss of agency, have the potential to hinder productivity, impact economic decision-making, and affect women’s financial empowerment. Further, depression can make it difficult for women to work, which subsequently may exacerbate the lower level of control over household spending many women in LMICs already face. The potential consequences of women’s depression may also extend to children: because women’s contributions to household income often increase spending on children, a woman’s diminished ability to work and make financial decisions can be a detriment to her children’s long-term outcomes.

Furthermore, antidepressant medication was not easily accessible. Additionally, in many parts of Pakistan, there are strict gender norms and low levels of women’s empowerment, with many women being excluded from making decisions in the household.", "details_inter": "A team of researchers worked with Basic Health Units in Gujar Khan and Kallar Syedan to evaluate the impact of CBT on women with perinatal depression.3 They developed a CBT-style program called the Thinking Healthy Program (THP), which involved identifying and modifying common depression-related thinking patterns, using active listening techniques, working closely with the women’s families, and providing a supported discovery of healthy thinking by gently asking about the family’s health beliefs and prompting alternative ideas. LHWs were trained to deliver the THP. When the LHW delivered the THP, it was not portrayed as treatment for a mental health condition. Researchers randomly chose forty communities from the two rural areas. Across these forty communities, 3,518 women in their third trimester of pregnancy were assessed for prenatal depression. Twenty-six percent, or 903 women, were found to suffer from major depression. Researchers then randomly split the forty communities into two groups: Comparison group: 440 women with perinatal depression who lived in the twenty communities of the comparison group were provided with routine maternal and health care services. Intervention group: 463 women with perinatal depression who lived in the twenty communities of the intervention group received the same routine care as the comparison group, with an additional component of the THP. Every woman in both the comparison and intervention group was visited sixteen times at home by an LHW. This was comprised of a weekly visit in the four weeks of the last pregnancy month, three visits in the first postnatal month, and a monthly visit for the following nine months. It cost US$10 per woman to deliver the THP. Follow-up surveys to evaluate maternal mental health, infant outcomes, and parenting behavior were conducted at six and twelve months postpartum. Then, seven years later, another team of researchers returned to the same two rural areas to survey the long-term effects of the THP. They were able to locate 289 mother-child pairs from the intervention group and 295 pairs from the comparison group, which is 64.8 percent of the original total program participants. In addition, the researchers identified 300 new pairs who were from the group of 3,518 women originally assessed for depression who did not meet the criteria for major depression at the time. They conducted interviews with the mothers and cognitive function tests with the children.", "results_lessons": "The CBT program led to significantly lower rates of depression in women in both the short-term and long-term. Short-term impacts: At six months postpartum, 23 percent of women in the intervention group were depressed compared to 53 percent of those in the comparison group. Similarly, at twelve months postpartum, 27 percent of the women in the intervention group were depressed as opposed to 59 percent in the comparison group.4 There was approximately a 30 percentage point reduction in rates of depression at six and twelve months postpartum. There was also an increase in how much both mothers and fathers reported interacting with the infant. There was no significant effect on infant growth. Long-term impacts on mothers: After seven years, researchers found that the women in the intervention group were 5 percentage points less likely to have clinical depression (a 17 percent decrease) than those in the comparison group, where 30 percent of women still had clinical depression. Notably, the researchers suggest that this smaller gap in outcomes is because the women in the comparison group had recovered and not because the women in the treatment intervention group had relapsed. Additionally, the impacts of the CBT were more significant for women who had daughters rather than sons. The researchers suggest that while women who were pregnant with girls initially felt more disempowered and depressed than those who were pregnant with boys, receiving the CBT program helped close the gap. After seven years, women in the intervention group also experienced greater financial empowerment. Improving women’s ability to earn income can lead to them having a greater say in household financial decisions. Indeed, seventeen percent more women in the intervention group had control over household spending compared to the comparison group, and control over spending was especially greater for mothers of girls. Long-term impacts on children: There was greater time and monetary investment in children’s education, particularly for girls, which is a well-documented outcome of women having more control over household spending. Children from the intervention group attended better schools, including private schools, and there were more learning materials in their homes. However, the researchers did not find significant effects on either cognitive and socio-emotional development or physical health and survival of the children whose mothers received the intervention. They suggest this may be because it can be difficult to detect impacts in seven-year-old children and the number of program participants may not have been large enough. Taken together, both the short- and long-term results indicate that reducing maternal depression, particularly through CBT, can be a low-cost and effective strategy to improve women’s and girls’ empowerment, especially in LMICs with more rigid gender roles. Following the publication of the short-term results, the World Health Organization endorsed the THP as a model of a low-cost, community-based program that can significantly impact depression in other countries.", "citations": "Rahman, Atif, Abid Malik, Siham Sikander, Christopher Roberts, and Francis Creed. \"Cognitive behaviour therapy-based intervention by community health workers for mothers with depression and their infants in rural Pakistan: a cluster-randomised controlled trial.\" The Lancet 372, no. 9642 (2008): 902-909.

Without this women representation, governments may construct different budgets and societies. Previous research notes that men typically advocate for budget allocation toward infrastructure and agriculture projects, while female political interests typically center around health, access to clean water, and poverty alleviation. While some countries have adopted laws that mandate a certain number of seats be reserved for women, these measures do not guarantee that women’s interests will be heard. Other programs that aim to increase women’s knowledge and participation do not necessarily increase the responsiveness of government officials to women’s requests. Studies that examine the effectiveness of such interventions are difficult to compare across different political and cultural contexts and there is little evidence on whether training male community leaders in addition to female community members is important to increase opportunities for women’s participation in local governance. Can a collective efficacy training for neighborhood women’s groups increase women’s participation in community decision-making? Is there any additional impact of educating male community leaders to be more inclusive of women’s political participation?", "context_of_eval": "In Indonesia, neighborhood associations, known as rukun tetangga (RT), serve as the most local touchpoint between citizens and their government. RTs are comprised of around thirty to fifty households, and the councils are governed by an RT chair, who is typically a married man. The RT meetings are typically only for men or heavily influenced by men. The RT chair then brings his neighborhood’s priorities to the larger village meetings, in which the village plan and budget are determined for the 3,000-10,000 residents across all neighborhoods. The RT chairs may also network with village officials to advocate for their concerns. To increase the autonomy of village governments and standardize opportunities for community input in village governance, the Indonesian government passed the 2014 Village Law. The law includes larger transfers of funds to villages for village governments and requirements for village governments to hold community consultations to inform village development plans and budgets, including a 30 percent quota for female attendance in such consultations. Despite this reform, political leaders continue to be overwhelmingly male at both the neighborhood and village levels and women’s preferences remain underrepresented. Women in neighborhoods often belong to all-female groups which meet regularly for rotating savings (arisan) and religious activities (yasinan). These groups also serve as social outlets but are not integrated into local budgeting or political activities. The arisan chair is often the wife of the RT chair, although she and the other women rarely attend the RT meetings except to prepare food. Many regencies in Indonesia have similar structures and gender norms to the Malang regency in East Java, where this study takes place. The evaluation team partnered with the Malang branch of a national NGO, PATTIRO, to deliver the trainings. PATTIRO has been involved in improving local governance and citizen participation initiatives since 2004. The Malang office has created resource hubs and managed both training and research to improve public engagement and accountability in local government.", "details_inter": "In partnership with PATTIRO, researchers conducted a randomized evaluation to test the impact of gender-focused trainings on female participation in neighborhood associations in the Malang regency, East Java, Indonesia. Researchers randomly assigned 100 Rakun Warga (RW), groups of three to five neighborhoods on average, including 300 neighborhoods in total across 15 villages to three different intervention groups: Placebo (50 RW including 150 neighborhoods): Arisan groups received financial literacy training and the RT chair received entrepreneurship training. This group served as the study’s comparison group. Arisan only (25 RW including 75 neighborhoods): Arisan groups received the empowerment and political skills training, and the RT chair received the budgeting training. Arisan + RT (25 RW including 75 neighborhoods): Participants in this group received the same training as the arisan groups plus a gender inclusion training for the RT and arisan chairs. The arisan skills training focused on understanding of local governance, fostering a sense of shared identity, and creating strategies for effective collective action and communication with community leaders. The RT and arisan chair-targeted training focused on women's empowerment reforms, fostering inclusivity by design in neighborhood meetings, and promoting joint interactions with higher-level village officials. PATTIRO led the training sessions over the course of two months. The trainings were marketed as general community development leadership trainings rather than gender empowerment trainings. Researchers will assess women’s participation through surveys with women community members and neighborhood leaders. The women’s survey includes an opportunity for women to share a proposal with their neighborhood association chair.

Researchers conducted a randomized evaluation to evaluate the impact of gender-based discrimination on female teleworkers’ productivity in online sales interactions with customers from seventy countries mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. Researchers found that when a customer chat representative had a female-sounding name, it led to significantly fewer purchases, and slower and more reserved reactions from customers.", "policy_issue": "While women’s share in service sector jobs is growing in low- and middle-income countries, gender inequality remains high. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the share of women working in full-time positions for a formal sector employer is less than 15 percent. Nevertheless, the share of working-age women in service jobs in Sub-Saharan Africa rose by 16 percent from 2011 to 2019 to reach 39.7 percent. Thus, service sector jobs are increasingly critical for poverty alleviation and income improvement. In sales and many other service jobs, workers are often evaluated on their ability to engage well with customers. However, if certain groups of workers (e.g., women, other marginalized groups) face discrimination from customers, it can lead to lower productivity for those affected workers. Bias from customers could also be a contributing factor to women’s persistently low labor force participation by deterring women from taking jobs, staying in jobs, or pursuing job advancement opportunities. There is little evidence on the scale and extent of customer discrimination against female workers, but shedding light on this phenomenon may help address subtle and unconscious sources of gender inequality in labor markets.", "context_of_eval": "Customer-facing roles are increasingly common in sub-Saharan Africa, where this evaluation took place. From 2011 to 2019 the percent of working-age individuals employed in the service sector increased by 12 percent. In this study researchers partnered with an established online travel agency with offices across sub-Saharan Africa. This company sold flights and hotels across Africa and employed a local workforce of sales agents to assist customers. These online sales agents serve as an example of customer sales roles typical in the service industry. Online sales interactions have become common in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic as well as the recent rapid digitalization of Africa. The customers were diverse: the firm’s customers originated from 70 countries (87 percent from Africa, 13 percent from outside of the continent). The majority of sales agents at the company were women, and they were responsible for 83 percent of chats with customers. According to the company’s administrative records, female and male sales agents appeared equally successful in terms of sales track record based on observed performance, and being a female worker did not seem to negatively affect sales performance, at least in correlational analysis.", "details_inter": "Researchers partnered with an online travel agency to conduct a randomized evaluation to test the impact of varying the name of the sales agent on gender-based discrimination. These names were gender-specific and signaled the agent’s gender identity to the customer only; workers themselves did not see which names they were assigned. Since the same sales agents were assigned male or female-sounding names at random, and the assignment of names changed nothing else, this allowed the researchers to isolate the effects of customer bias arising from the worker’s gender identity. Researchers developed a protocol to randomly assign a gendered name to 2,655 online customer interactions with six female sales agents. On a daily basis from January to October 2019, sales agents were randomly given “female” or “male” treatment status, which meant that their chat interface showed a randomly chosen female or male-sounding first name. The names were drawn from local school yearbooks and coded by the local research team, and only first names appeared in the chats. The average chat lasted 22 minutes. As outcome measures, researchers measured data including customers’ travel purchases, which were a key measure of productivity in the studied job. The research team also examined the intervention’s effects on customer-agent chat interactions in terms of chat response, tone and topic (by coding the chat transcripts), whether customers bargained with or harassed agents, and chat purpose to gain additional insights into customer behavior.", "results_lessons": "Researchers saw large negative effects when the worker had a female-sounding name, compared to a male-sounding name. When agents randomly received a female-sounding name, it reduced the likelihood of customers making a purchase of a flight or hotel within 48 hours by 3.8 percentage points (from 7.6 percent in the comparison group to 3.8 percent in the intervention group). This represented a 50 percent drop. All agents in the study experienced negative effects after being assigned a female-sounding name; the least affected agents still experienced a 25 percent reduction in purchases – a significant cut in a key measure of productivity in the studied job. Researchers found supporting evidence that these results were driven by a lag in response from customers, implying that customers were less engaged when interacting with female sales agents. The researchers did not find evidence that customer disengagement led to harassment or differences in terms of how customers tried to bargain. This randomized evaluation suggested that female agents in this firm were likely more productive than male agents but for the penalty on their productivity due to customer bias. Overall, data from this study suggested that gender-based customer bias could impact women’s work productivity in low-income countries. In the study, customer bias negatively affected all workers, implying that the discrimination the researchers found did not depend on individual workers’ different characteristics other than their gender. In addition, customer bias was found in similar rates from customers across different parts of Africa and from outside of Africa. These patterns imply that women in service jobs may be suffering widely from consequences of customer bias, both in online sales and African contexts, and in contexts beyond this specific evaluation. Researchers suggest that customer discrimination may act as an obstacle to women’s labor market success.

Thus, the best way to prevent the disease was to wear a mask, wash hands frequently, and keep distance from others.2 To promote these behaviors, the Zambian Ministry of Health Risk Communication and Community Engagement Working Group (MoH) developed community messaging strategies to combat the spread of Covid-19. They adopted various dissemination campaigns to promote public health behaviors among the population using radio, television, Twitter, social media, and SMS messages. As almost 90 percent of Zambia’s population had access to mobile phones in 2021, mobile phone campaigns served as a viable tool for disseminating key messages.3 In 2015, 51.5 percent of the Zambian population were women, and the average household size was 5.1 people. 20.2 percent of the population had secondary school education and 8.4 percent had post-secondary schooling. In comparison, the participants in the study had attained higher levels of education on average and reflected a higher proportion of men.

The information campaign consisted of small cash incentives and SMS texts, translated into five local languages, which provided concrete steps to reduce Covid-19 transmission. In particular, the messages promoted four main behaviors: wearing masks in public, washing hands, social distancing, and avoiding blaming others for becoming infected. Over thirteen days, researchers sent out the messages in three waves, and two additional messages on the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine were introduced in the second wave. Each participant received three SMSs over the course of the intervention, with the order of the messages randomized. Researchers asked the 3,027 participants to provide contact information of up to five people to whom they would be willing to forward health related SMSs. The participants were then randomly assigned into one of four groups: Peer forwarding group (Group 1, 729 individuals): These participants received an SMS from a health authority with recommended health behaviors and were asked to forward it to their five contacts, without receiving a financial incentive. Peer forwarding with incentive group (Group 2, 787 individuals): These participants received an SMS from a health authority with recommended health behaviors and were asked to forward it to their five contacts. They were also offered a financial incentive of 23 Kwacha (US$ 1.07 in 2021) per SMS forwarded at the end of the study. Health authority to peer group (Group 3, 751 individuals): Participants in this group received an SMS like in the first two groups. Their five contacts also received an SMS directly from a local health authority. Comparison group (Group 4, 760 individuals): These participants received an SMS with recommended health behaviors, but they were not asked to forward it to their five contacts. In addition to the four groups described above, the researchers randomly assigned each participant to either receive the SMS from the MoH or the ZNPHI, an independent, public agency that has less authority than the MoH but may be perceived as less political and more technical to each participant.

There were no differences between the groups who received messages from the MoH versus the ZNPHI. Precautionary health behaviors: Neither asking participants to forward health messages, incentivizing them, or directly sending health messages to peers changed the precautionary health behaviors (masking, hand washing, not traveling outside the village, or avoiding gatherings) of peers. Researchers hypothesize that this could be because text messages are less compelling than personal outreach, or because information about Covid-19 was already being widely disseminated by radio, newspaper, and through social media throughout the country.

In partnership with an education assessment firm, researchers conducted a randomized evaluation to isolate the impact of computer-based individualized instruction in India. After nine months, lower-performing students in grades six to eight learned 22 percent of a standard deviation more in math if offered materials that matched their learning levels. For the average student, individualized instruction did not affect math learning. The results suggest that individualized instruction is most beneficial for low performers.", "policy_issue": "As in other low-income countries, many Indian students lag behind expected grade-level performance,1 and this gap between students’ expected and actual performance tends to widen starting in primary school. Also, learning levels often vary dramatically between students, even in the same classroom, and teachers can find it challenging to provide targeted instruction that matches the individual needs of each student. School closures during the Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated these issues, which many experts describe as an acute learning crisis. Meanwhile, in many low- and middle-income countries, tailoring instruction to students’ learning levels has emerged as a promising strategy to close learning gaps—whether through teacher-led interventions that promote differentiated instruction (e.g., “Teaching at the Right Level”) or computer-adaptive learning software (e.g., “Mindspark”). However, as such programs usually bundle different components, and since they often also imply additional study time for students, prior studies have been unable to tie their effects on learning to individualized instruction. With this in mind, what are the isolated impacts of personalized instruction on student learning?", "context_of_eval": "Rajasthan is a populous Indian state, with three-quarters of its residents living in rural areas. Its average education levels roughly mirror those in the rest of India: for example, a similar percentage of sixth graders can subtract a two-digit number by another two-digit number (25 percent in Rajasthan, compared to 24 percent across rural India).2 Within rural areas across India, including Rajasthan, the Indian Ministry of Human Resource Development establishes “model schools” to promote education in disadvantaged rural areas. They teach students in grades six to twelve, English is the language of instruction, and they follow a national curriculum instead of a state curriculum. In 2017, when the evaluation took place, there were 134 model schools in Rajasthan; 64 percent of the state’s district sub-divisions had at least one such school. Model schools admit students through a selective entrance exam. Thus, their students have higher average achievement compared to traditional government schools. Nevertheless, in the model schools sampled in this evaluation, there are large gaps between expected and actual performance at each grade level. For example, in math, the average sixth grader is two grade levels behind national standards. A leading assessment firm, Educational Initiatives (EI), developed a computer-adaptive math learning software called Mindspark, over a ten-year period. It has been used by over 500,000 students. When students first log into Mindspark, they take a diagnostic test, which identifies what they know and can do and the areas where they can improve. Then, the software presents them with exercises appropriate for their preparation level based on the diagnostic test. The difficulty and topic covered by subsequent exercises dynamically adjust to each student’s progress. Other research has documented the positive impacts of this software on student learning, both in after-school centers in Delhi and in Rajasthan’s government schools. However, the software comprises many different features, and it is unclear to what extent individualized instruction drives its effectiveness.", "details_inter": "In partnership with EI and over a period of nine months in 2017, the researchers evaluated the impact of the individualization component of Mindspark on learning outcomes for 1,528 students in grades six to eight from fifteen model schools across Rajasthan. The researchers randomly assigned students into two groups: Comparison group: These students used a version of Mindspark without the individualized instruction component; in other words, they received instruction that matched their enrolled grade level. Intervention group: These students used a version of Mindspark with the individualized instruction component. Students used Mindspark in school during their regular math classes over a period of nine months. The researchers’ randomization approach was such that within each grade level classroom, there was a random mix of students assigned to the comparison or intervention group. Because the only thing distinguishing those students who received individualized instruction from others that did not is chance, any differences in learning between them can be attributed to personalization.", "results_lessons": "There were no meaningful differences in learning outcomes for the average student who received the fully personalized version of Mindspark relative to those who used the grade-level version of the software. However, access to personalized instruction significantly improved the math achievement of those students who were initially low-performing. Those students in the intervention group who started the program in the bottom 25 percent of performers in their grade saw a positive effect of 0.22 standard deviations in their math learning. These gains were concentrated in the topics and skills that featured more frequently in the software. They were driven by students’ improved ability concerning number concepts and operations (as opposed to geometry and measurement or data-related concepts). These positive impacts were also driven by greater improvements in applied math learning and problem-solving (as opposed to rote learning). The researchers measured students’ math ability with paper-based assessments (not on computers or tablets); therefore, the study’s measure of math achievement is not confounded with students’ ability to engage with technology. The typical student used the software for 329 minutes across the nine months of the study. This usage level is low compared to that of an out-of-school version of Mindspark from another evaluation. There was also considerable variation in the level of interaction from week to week. The researchers suggested that this may have been related to challenges the schools faced regarding classroom or computer availability and teacher coordination. Overall, these results suggest that low-performing students may stand to benefit the most from individualized instruction, at least in the context of computer-adaptive learning software. This is the first study to document this relationship through an experimental evaluation in a developing country. More broadly, studies like this also indicate the potential for individualized learning and targeted instruction—either with or without education technologies like Mindspark—to help lead to improved educational outcomes for students who are low-performing.", "citations": "de Barros, Andreas, and Alejandro J.
