Financial hardship often creates stress, which may lead to mental illness over time. In turn, mental health challenges can reduce labor force participation and productivity, deepening poverty. This suggests that while individual poverty or mental health interventions may yield cross-sector benefits, integrated programs addressing both issues simultaneously might be particularly effective in breaking the cycle. Additionally, if mental health and poverty are strongly connected, interventions that address both simultaneously might be particularly effective. Can interventions targeting either poverty or mental health, or both together, improve both economic and psychological well-being?", "context_of_eval": "The evaluation was conducted in Nakuru County in Central Kenya, an area selected due to the implementing NGO already having established a presence there, as well as high levels of people living in poverty and with poor mental health. Before the study, 33 percent of the study participants were classified as experiencing psychological distress, according to the NGO’s criteria. The psychotherapy program evaluated in this study, Problem Management Plus (PM+), was run by a large international NGO that hired and trained clinical supervisors and community health assistants, who in turn trained community health workers (CHWs). The program was developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) specifically for low-resource settings. PM+ had previously shown effectiveness in improving mental health in Kenya in a study with women who had experienced gender-based violence1. The cash transfers were delivered by Busara Center for Behavioral Economics through M-Pesa (mobile money transfer system operated by Safaricom that allows people to deposit and withdraw money at various locations throughout Kenya). The majority of respondents had personal M-Pesa accounts, and those who did not were offered phones to set up accounts.", "details_inter": "Researchers partnered with a large international NGO and the Busara Center for Behavioral Economics to evaluate the impact of unconditional cash transfers, a psychotherapy program, and their combination on measures of economic and psychological well-being. First, they randomly assigned 233 villages in rural Kenya to one of four following groups and then randomly assigned 5,756 low-income households across these villages: Cash transfer Group (CT) (540 households in 60 villages): Households were offered an unconditional cash transfer of US$1,076 purchasing power parity2 (PPP) (US$485 nominal), corresponding to about 20 months of per capita consumption. Cash transfers were randomly delivered as a lump-sum payment or in five weekly installments. Problem Management Plus Group (PM+) (525 households in 60 villages): Households were offered the PM+ psychotherapy intervention, which consisted of five 90-minute one-on-one sessions over five weeks delivered by community health workers (CHWs). The program taught five strategies: problem-solving, managing stress, managing problems, behavioral activation (\"get going, keep doing\"), and strengthening social support. Combined Group (CT&PM+) (493 households in 53 villages): Households were offered both the cash transfer and the PM+ intervention. Comparison Group (1,703 households in 60 villages): Households were not offered any program. The programs were delivered between May 2017 and January 2018 with two breaks in August and October-November 2017 due to elections. To study the effect of the program, researchers implemented a survey both before the program started (between October 2016 and March 2017) and about a year after the program ended (between August 2018 and May 2019). The surveys included questions on consumption, food security, assets, revenue, profits, labor, education, psychological well-being, and intimate partner violence. To assess indirect and unintended effects at the village-level (spillovers), researchers also surveyed non-recipient households in areas receiving the CT-only (1,237 households) and PM+-only (1,219 households) interventions. In villages assigned to CT and CT&PM+, half of the cash transfer recipients were randomly given a lump-sum payment, while the other half received five weekly installments, allowing researchers to study how transfer frequency influences outcomes.", "results_lessons": "One year after the interventions, cash transfers improved both economic and psychological outcomes, while the psychotherapy program had no measurable positive effects on either outcome. The effects of the combined intervention were similar to those of cash transfers alone. Economic outcomes: The cash transfers improved economic as well as psychological wellbeing. Households who were assigned to receive a cash transfer had a 20 percent increase in monthly consumption (an increase by US$10.51 PPP compared to a comparison group mean of US$52.49 PPP), a 47 percent increase in asset holdings (an increase of US$262.06 PPP compared to a comparison group mean of US$553.16 PPP), and a 26 percent increase in household revenue (an increase by US$35.18 PPP per month compared to the comparison average of US$135.48 PPP) one year after the program ended. The PM+ intervention did not significantly affect economic outcomes and there was no significant difference between the PM+ Group and the comparison group. The results between the CT group households and the CT&PM+ group were very similar, with asset holdings increasing by 41 percent, and household revenue by 17 percent. However, the combined program had a measurable, but not significant impact on consumption. Psychological well-being: Cash transfers improved an index of psychological well-being by 0.23 standard deviations. This improvement was driven by a 0.21 standard deviation increase in life satisfaction, a 0.19 standard deviation increase in happiness, and 0.16 standard deviation decreases in both perceived stress and psychological distress measured by the General Health Questionnaire-12 (a 12-item screener for general psychiatric conditions)3. Households who received both programs improved psychological well-being by 0.27 standard deviations, similar to the effect of cash transfers alone. However, the combined program had a larger impact on life satisfaction (0.39 standard deviations) compared to cash transfers alone (0.21 standard deviations). In contrast, households who received only the PM+ program experienced no effect on psychological well-being. PM+ also had no effects on psychological well-being among participants who had high psychological distress before the evaluation. Since the PM+ program had previously been implemented successfully by the same NGO in Kenya, researchers assume that it may be most effective when used to address a specific problem (previously, survivors of gender-based violence were targeted), rather than general psychological distress. Transfer frequency: Weekly cash transfers were more effective than lump-sum transfers in improving economic outcomes. Weekly transfers increased consumption by US$14.98 PPP (28 percent) and monthly household revenue by US$51.71 PPP (39 percent), while the effect on all other outcomes were not statistically significant. Taken together, the research showed that the PM+ treatment alone did not improve outcomes, but that cash transfers were effective in improving both economic and psychological well-being in this context.", "citations": "Haushofer, Johannes, Robert Mudida, and Jeremy Shapiro. \" The Comparative Impact of Cash Transfers and a Psychotherapy Program on Psychological and Economic Well-being.\" Working Paper February 2023. https://haushofer.ne.su.se/publications/Haushofer_Mudida_Shapiro_Cash_Therapy_2023.pdf.", "run_id": "2026-02-24 180833", "scraped_at": "2026-02-24T18:10:24", "hash": "9defbc3a0e8fcebc9540dc744918a96ef75b692c8d6c420434d2e39ad1ae5988"}

To address this, researchers conducted a randomized evaluation to test the impact of an in-school remedial education program on student learning in Odisha, India. Both the standard and a version that allowed teacher flexibility improved student test scores without reducing grade- level mastery or affecting the likelihood of passing exams.", "policy_issue": "Public-sector organizations often face a fundamental trade-off: whether to allow workers discretion to adapt services to local needs or enforce rigid, standardized rules to ensure uniform delivery. Education systems face a similar tension. Low learning levels among secondary school students are a persistent challenge in many low- and middle-income countries. Public schools often follow a standardized curriculum that assumes students are performing at grade level, even when many are years behind. Despite this gap, teachers are expected to deliver grade-level content on a fixed schedule, often enforced by high-stakes exams. While teaching students at their level has shown promise in primary education, there is limited evidence on its effectiveness in secondary schools, where learning gaps are wider and classrooms more mixed in ability. Policymakers also worry that giving teachers flexibility could lead to poor teaching or reduced effort. This evaluation addresses a key question: Can remedial education help secondary students catch up without harming those already at grade level, and could giving teachers more flexibility help to amplify these gains?", "context_of_eval": "In India, many students enter secondary school far behind grade level. Grades 9 and 10 are a critical bridge to higher education but are associated with high dropout rates, especially among girls. Students often lack the foundational skills needed to understand advanced material or succeed on the high-stakes Class 10 board exams. In the Indian state of Odisha, about one-third of the population lives below the national poverty line. Nearly half of its secondary students fail to meet basic international benchmarks in math, though the top 5 percent outperform peers in other low-income countries, highlighting stark learning disparities. This study focused on 300 government secondary schools in two largely rural districts, Jajpur and Dhenkanal. Among those in the study, about 40 percent belonged to Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes (disadvantaged groups in India), and 15 percent had parents who could not read or write. At the start of the program, the average Class 9 student was 4–5 grade levels behind in English, math, and the local language Odia, and nearly half tested below Class 3 competency. The Utkarsh (“Excellence”) program, developed by Transform Schools, People for Action, and the Kusuma Trust UK, and implemented with the Odisha Department of School and Mass Education, aims to help Class 9 students strengthen foundational skills and prepare for board exams by leveraging existing teachers and class time. It combines remedial and grade-level instruction across three phases: 18 days of basic skill building (Foundation Camp), 45 days to reinforce and apply these skills (Supported Learning Phase), and 6 days of grade-level preparation (Consolidation Camp).", "details_inter": "Researchers partnered with Transform Schools, People for Action (PFA), and the Odisha Department of School and Mass Education to conduct a randomized evaluation to measure the impact of two variations of Utkarsh. Researchers randomly assigned 300 government secondary schools in the Jaipur and Dhenkanal districts to one of three groups: Standard group (100 schools). These schools received the full version of Utkarsh. Teachers were trained in a one-week session and provided with teaching and learning materials, including daily topic outlines and student worksheets, organized into class- specific phases covering concepts from Classes 3–8. They were instructed to implement topics and lesson plans according to a pre-specified schedule. Lessons were not fully scripted, and all instruction occurred during the regular school day using existing teachers and infrastructure. Flexible group (100 schools). These schools received the same Utkarsh training and materials as the standard group, but teachers were given the guidance that they had the flexibility to adapt topics and/or timelines according to the needs of their students. Comparison group (100 schools). These schools did not receive the Utkarsh program and continued with the regular curriculum and teaching. Before the program began, researchers administered tests in Odia, math, and English to understand students’ initial skills. To understand how the program was being implemented in practice, they made unannounced classroom visits during the intervention, when schools were expected to be carrying out FC or SLP. About four months after the program began, researchers administered surveys and standardized tests in Odia, math, English, and science to measure learning outcomes. Because regular Class 10 exams were canceled due to COVID-19, they later collected administrative data on Board Marks, based on a weighted average of their teacher- assigned Class 9 (40 percent) and Class 10 (60 percent) scores, and conducted a follow-up phone survey to track students’ schooling and employment outcomes.", "results_lessons": "Both the structured and flexible versions of the Utkarsh remedial education program improved student learning in similar amounts relative to the comparison group, without crowding out grade- level skills, and were cost-effective. Short-term learning gains. Students in both Utkarsh groups scored an average of 0.11 standard deviations higher in Odia, English, mathematics, and science at the end of the school year relative to the comparison group’s learning progress of 0.19 standard deviations in the same period. In practical terms, this roughly translates to 60 percent of a typical year of learning, meaning students learned in one term what the comparison group would normally achieve in a little over one and a half terms. The likelihood of achieving Class 3 or Class 5 competency rose by 3–8 percentage points, depending upon subject, relative to the comparison group. However, there were no difference in full Class 9 mastery between the program and comparison groups. Researchers noted this was unsurprising because the program’s four-month timeframe was too short for students who were 4–5 grades behind to catch up fully, and importantly, students already at or near grade level did not fall behind, indicating the program did not harm higher-performing students. Longer-term outcomes. Students in the intervention groups did not pass the exams at higher rates, as pass rates were already extremely high—over 99 percent in both program and comparison schools. However, students in the Standard Utkarsh arm received slightly lower average Board Marks, a pattern researchers interpret as consistent with teachers’ more realistic grading after better understanding students’ true learning levels through the program’s leveling exams and exposure to remedial content. The effect on Board Marks for the Flexible group was about half as large, and the evidence did not clearly rule out chance as an explanation. Two years after the program, researchers found no measurable differences in school enrollment or employment outcomes between students in the program and comparison groups. Teacher engagement and program delivery. Researchers found no evidence that flexibility reduced teacher effort or resulted in neglect of duties. Even without explicit flexibility, many teachers adjusted lesson pacing and content to match student needs: nearly 77 percent of comparison group teachers and 78 percent of Standard Utkarsh teachers reported they could adjust content if students struggled, and this rose to about 84 percent in the Flexible arm. Only 82 percent of Standard Utkarsh teachers and 73 percent of Flexible Utkarsh teachers stayed within one week of the official timetable. While teachers in the flexible group made slightly more deviations from the prescribed schedule, they largely continued delivering remedial material. Teachers in intervention schools also developed more accurate perceptions of their students’ abilities by the end of the program, reducing their estimates of student’s literacy and numeracy by 5–11 percentage points. In structured education systems, improving service delivery may require adjusting rules and giving teachers more freedom to respond to local needs. While there are often concerns about disrupting established routines, researchers found that teachers were able to successfully adapt to a new, more effective classroom approach that benefited both them and their students. Use of Results: The Utkarsh program has been scaled up both across the original state (Odisha, population 40 million) and also in new states (Karnataka, population 60 million; Chhattisgarh, 30 million; Haryana, 25 million; and Uttar Pradesh, 236 million). It has already reached more than 9.1 million students, and there are plans to expand the program further. Cost-analysis: At a 200-school scale, the program cost approximately US$11.64 per student, with both versions equally cost-effective. This translates to a gain of 0.95 SD in overall test scores per $100 spent. This places Utkarsh among the most cost-effective secondary school interventions documented in South Asia, comparable to Mindspark, which increased learning outcomes by 0.93 SD per $100 at a 50-school scale and the eLearn program which increased test scores by 1.4 SD per $100 at a 200-school scale.", "citations": "Beg, Sarbin A., Anne E.

Individuals who engaged in group discussions and individuals who were shown a video that affirmed the legal rights of transgender individuals were more likely to hire transgender individuals. Group discussions were most effective.", "policy_issue": "Discrimination carries high economic costs. Biased managers can make workers from minority groups less productive, while prejudice contributes to significant wage gaps that harm both individuals and the broader economy.1 Though individual prejudice is often seen as deep-seated and difficult to change, social norms can shift rapidly; in recent decades, many societies have seen dramatic increases in acceptance for gender equality, gay rights, and interethnic marriage.2 This suggests that interventions targeting social dynamics, not just individual beliefs, may be effective. A well-studied approach is to foster contact between majority and minority groups, which has been shown to reduce prejudice.3 For instance, mixing Christian and Muslim youth in Nigerian classrooms successfully reduced discrimination.4 However, the reach of such interventions is limited by a simple reality: people mostly interact with others from their own identity group.5 This makes scalable intergroup contact difficult. It also raises an underexplored question for policymakers: can communication within the majority group itself be harnessed to reduce discrimination against an outside minority?", "context_of_eval": "This study focuses on the thirunangai, a community of transgender women in the state of Tamil Nadu, India, with a long-standing cultural and religious role in society. Their visually recognizable identity, however, leaves them particularly susceptible to economic discrimination and violence. Transgender people are often excluded from traditional forms of paid employment, pushing many into poverty and sex work. There are at least 0.5-1.25 million transgender people in India, implying that such discrimination results in large welfare and efficiency costs. The study took place in urban Chennai with 3,397 non-transgender participants. This context is marked by a stark disconnect between norms and behavior. While discriminatory actions are common, there is widespread agreement that discrimination is wrong; 93 percent of comparison group participants described an act of discrimination as wrong. Recent legal changes, such as a 2014 Supreme Court ruling affirming the constitutional rights of transgender people, have had relatively limited impact on behavior, partly due to low awareness (36 percent of the participants were unaware of these rights). This gap between what people do (descriptive norms) and what they say is right (prescriptive norms) provided a unique opportunity to test whether communication could activate latent anti-discrimination sentiment.", "details_inter": "The researcher conducted a randomized evaluation to measure the impact of group discussions between non-transgender individuals and video screenings about legal rights on hiring discrimination against transgender individuals. The researcher randomly assigned 3,397 non-transgender individuals into variations of group discussions described below. The experiment was framed as market research for a grocery delivery service to measure real hiring decisions while minimizing the risk that participants would guess the study's true purpose. The primary outcome was measured through a series of 10 private, binary hiring choices. In each choice, participants were shown photos of two potential delivery workers—one always a cisgender man and the other a cisgender man, a cisgender woman, or a transgender woman—and had to choose one. Their choice involved real trade-offs between the worker they preferred and the groceries they would receive. Participants were assigned to the following groups: 3-person discussion (890 participants): All three participants in the group engaged in a 10-minute discussion about their preferred hiring choices and then made collective decisions about which workers to select. 2-person discussion (549 participants): Two participants were randomly selected to discuss and make choices for the group while the third participant listened to the discussion. Public but no discussion (599 participants): All three participants made their individual choices with the knowledge that the choices would be later revealed to the group. This group did not engage in a discussion prior to decision making. Comparison group (1,365 participants): Participants made all ten choices individually and privately. To compare the impact of the different group discussions with information sharing through video screenings, the researchers also randomly assigned the same 3,397 individuals into three additional groups: Legal rights video (1,135 participants): Participants watched a 2-minute video showing information on the Supreme Court of India’s ruling giving transgender people the same fundamental rights as others. Rights messaging video (1,135 participants): Participants watched a video in which they were told that transgender people should have the same fundamental rights as others without mentioning that they have these rights. Comparison group (1,135 participants): Participants watched a video that discussed voting rights but did not mention transgender rights. To measure the impact of the group discussions and the videos, researchers examined private participants’ hiring choices after the intervention to see if they selected transgender workers more often. On average 35 days after the initial survey, participants were given another survey to measure the persistence of their choices.", "results_lessons": "Both participating in group discussions and being informed about the legal rights of transgender individuals through videos reduced hiring discrimination against transgender women among residents of Chennai. One month after the intervention only individuals in the group discussions continued to discriminate less. Hiring choices: Compared to individuals in the comparison group that did not take part in group discussions, participants in 3-person discussions (group one) were 17 percentage points more likely to select a transgender individual for their delivery (a 42 percent increase). Participants in the 2-person discussion arm (group two) were 13 percentage points more likely while participants in the public but no-discussion arm (group three), were not more likely than the comparison group to hire transgender individuals. Participants who were offered the legal rights video and the rights messaging video were 10.3 percentage points (a 23 percent increase) and 5.8 percentage points (a 13 percent increase) more to hire a transgender individual, respectively. Benchmarking discrimination: Group discussion reduced participants’ willingness to sacrifice grocery items to avoid hiring a transgender worker. Participants in the comparison group were willing to forgo items worth nearly twice the median daily per capita food expenditure whereas those in the 3-person discussion arm (group one) were not willing to sacrifice any items, on average. Persistence of reduced discrimination: Participants in the 3-person discussion arm (group one) continued to discriminate less for 2-9 weeks after the discussions took place. These participants were four percentage points (an eleven percent increase) more likely to hire transgender individuals in a hypothetical follow-up decision compared to participants in the comparison group. In other words, 25 percent of the short-term impact persisted after approximately one month. On the other hand, participants who viewed transgender rights videos did not discriminate less one month after the intervention. Participants’ behavior likely shifted because the group discussions changed the perceived social norms around hiring. Pro-transgender participants spoke up more often, making supportive statements 2.5 times more common than anti-transgender ones. Their arguments were morally persuasive, emphasizing values like opportunity, rights, and equality. This imbalance appears to have led participants to revise their views of how much others discriminate—raising their estimates of neighbors’ willingness to hire transgender workers by 24 percentage points. Policy Lessons: Promote peer-to-peer dialogue: In the right circumstances, communication within existing social networks can be an inexpensive way to reduce discrimination. However, this might not always work.. In cases where people claim to already be against discrimination, governments and NGOs could consider designing and testing programs that facilitate structured but undirected conversations in community centers, schools, and workplaces. Target contexts where prescriptive norms are favorable: This approach is most likely to succeed in settings where a gap already exists between widespread discriminatory behavior and a widely held belief that discrimination is wrong. Attitude surveys can help identify these promising contexts. Empower internal advocates: The study shows a vocal minority can drive change. Rather than relying on outside experts, policies can be designed to identify and empower members within a community or organization who already promote fairness training them to become effective advocates for shifting group norms.", "citations": "\"Silence to Solidarity: Using Group Dynamics to Reduce Anti-Transgender Discrimination in India.\" Working Paper 2024.", "run_id": "2026-02-24 180833", "scraped_at": "2026-02-24T18:10:24", "hash": "ff45dc6f4e27cf67573775ab143b83e36157e240696e03bf88070da032b76225"}

Globally, women earn 20 percent less than men on average, and are less likely to participate in the labor force or hold decision-making roles. Family members, religious leaders, and community expectations often uphold restrictive gender norms that limit women’s autonomy in education, employment, and household decisions. These restrictions, in turn, contribute to lower female labor force participation. Programs that aim to shift gender norms often address gender directly, but this can trigger backlash in conservative settings. While job training programs are typically designed to improve employment outcomes, their effects on gender norms are less understood. Emerging evidence suggests that such programs can influence outcomes beyond the labor market, like reducing crime recidivism by helping participants build skills, access employment, and strengthen social ties that promote stability and reduce risky behaviors. Can job training also shift gender attitudes in a similar way, by exposing participants to new people and beliefs at their workplaces?", "context_of_eval": "In Kaduna and Katsina, two states in Northern Nigeria, many women are held back from making their own choices about education, employment, and mobility because of strict gender norms and a conservative interpretation of Islam. Both states have been under Sharia law since the early 2000s. Women often face restrictions under the practice of kulle (seclusion), which in its strictest form prohibits married women from interacting with non-family members of the opposite sex. These norms are reflected in attitudes among youth: 77 percent of the study sample said that husbands should decide whether wives are allowed to work outside the home. Girls also face pressure to marry and have children early. At age 20, 41 percent of women in the study were married, compared to just 1 percent of men. 55 percent of caregivers believed that husbands alone should decide whether the couple has children. Fathers of unmarried girls often have the final say over decisions about education, training, and employment. These gender norms contribute to low levels of female labor force participation and social empowerment, which in turn are linked to high poverty rates. In Kaduna and Katsina, 74 and 66 percent of people live under US$1 per day, respectively. Unemployment rates in both states exceed 25 percent.", "details_inter": "From 2015 to 2020, Adam Smith International ran the Mafita program in Northern Nigeria to help marginalized youth access skilled work or self-employment. Mafita included outreach, mentoring, support services, as well as a vocational training program known as the Community Skills Development Centers (COSDEC) program. In partnership with the Nigerian National Board for Technical Education, Mafita designed a locally relevant COSDEC curriculum. COSDEC targeted low-income youth aged 15 to 24, including early school leavers, orphans and vulnerable children, persons with disabilities, and those with limited access to formal education. Training began with three months of foundational (literacy, numeracy, and basic science) and soft skills (goal-setting, interpersonal communication, etc.) followed by nine months of trade training in one of seven areas: Carpentry and Joinery, Electrical Installation, Fashion Design, Hospitality, Masonry, Office Management, and Welding and Fabrication. Researchers conducted a randomized evaluation in Northern Nigeria to test the impact of providing a gender-neutral job training to marginalized youth on their gender norms by expanding their economic opportunities. The training took place in six different centers in Kaduna and Katsina, with a total of 1,824 participants. Participants applied to a specific trade training at their local center. Researchers then randomly selected 900 applicants from the different center-trade applicant pools to be offered the training, known as the intervention group. Some intervention group participants also engaged in an additional two-month training in entrepreneurship and business administration. The remaining 924 participants were assigned to the comparison group, did not receive any training, and were not allowed to apply to a different trade or center for the duration of the study. The evaluation ran from April 2017 to March 2018, with 73 percent of participants in the intervention group completing the program; researchers measured outcomes nine to fourteen months later. Researchers measured youth gender norms through an index that combined survey responses around household decision-making, women’s equality and role in society, and domestic violence. They measured caregiver gender norms through a similar index that included female labor force participation and excluded domestic violence. Researchers also measured economic outcomes through the income and employment index which combined indicators on wage employment status, days worked, and monthly earnings.", "results_lessons": "Youth who were offered job training adopted more progressive gender views, even though the training did not discuss gender. Their caregivers also became more supportive of women’s roles in work and decision-making. Evidence suggests that job training helped youth from conservative communities enter the labor market and build new social connections, which fostered more progressive gender views. Labor Market Success: Youth who were offered training were 4.2 percentage points more likely to be employed compared to 10.9 percent employment among their peers (a 39 percent increase). They were also 13.7 percentage points more likely to be self-employed, from a base of 38 percent. Youth in the training group also earned ₦403 (USD 1.3) more per month than the comparison group (a 54 percent increase from a baseline of ₦752 (USD 2.5). Evidence indicates that labor market success explains about 20 percent of the shift in gender norms after the training. Researchers suggest that when youth secured jobs following the training, they observed women succeeding in the workplace and encountered new beliefs through interactions with coworkers, customers and bosses. Social interaction: Youth who were offered training broadened their social interactions without losing existing connections or altering religious beliefs. They had 0.013 more friends of the opposite gender (a 29 percent increase from 0.045 in the comparison group). They also had, on average, 0.12 more friends from outside their neighborhood (a 10 percent increase from 1.2) and 0.27 more friends who were employed (a 10 percent increase from 2.8). Although trained youth did not report more friends from other religions or any new opinions on religious enforcement, they reported greater trust in leaders and people of other religions. These shifts in social interaction appear to be a key mechanism through which economic gains led to changes in gender attitudes: broader social networks were associated with more progressive views on women’s roles in society and household decision-making. Youths’ Gender norms: As a result of the training, youth adopted more equitable views on household decision-making norms and women’s role in society. For example, youth who were offered training were 8.8 percentage points more likely to believe boys should do as much domestic work as girls (a 31 percent increase from 28 percent). Similarly, trained youth were 6.2 percentage points more likely to believe girls should speak as much as boys in class, a 14 percent increase from 45 percent in the comparison group. Caregivers’ gender attitudes: Caregivers of participants also showed improved gender attitudes. For example, the belief that women should occupy leadership positions in society increased by 6.5 percentage points from a baseline of 85 percent, an 8 percent increase. Similarly, the belief that girls should speak as much as boys in class rose by 6.9 percentage points from a baseline of 75 percent, a 9 percent increase. These effects were particularly strong for caregivers with a female dependent enrolled in the study. Vocational training can be a powerful tool not only for improving economic livelihoods but also for shifting gender beliefs in conservative societies, even when the curriculum does not directly address gender inequity.", "citations": "Crost, Benjamin, Oeindrila Dube, Marcus Holmlund, Eric Mvukiyehe, and Emily Crawford. \"Can Economics Opportunities Reshape Gender Norms among Religious Youth?

Growing evidence shows low teacher effort can contribute to this. Contract teacher programs, where teachers are hired on short-term contracts at lower wages, have shown promise in improving learning outcomes at low cost, particularly when implemented by NGOs. These programs add more teachers to schools at a lower cost, thus reducing class sizes. Contracts can be renewed for strong performers, which helps schools keep better teachers, and the lack of permanent tenure gives teachers stronger incentives to work hard. Importantly, NGOs have partnered with government schools to implement these programs, showing that the model can work in public education systems. However, it remains unclear whether such programs can be effectively scaled by governments, which often face political resistance and limited bureaucratic capacity. This evaluation addresses a critical question: Can governments replicate the success of NGO-led education interventions at scale?", "context_of_eval": "In Kenya, 81 percent of children are enrolled in primary school as of 2006. However, learning outcomes remain low. Only three out of ten third-grade students could read a basic English story or solve second-grade division problems. This issue is often attributed to the severe shortage of qualified teachers: in 2011, the government reported a gap of 61,000 civil service teachers in the country due largely to a hiring freeze. At the same time, civil service salaries were relatively high, creating a long queue of qualified graduates waiting for government teaching jobs. To address this, the government piloted a contract teacher initiative, providing funds to schools to hire teachers on short-term, lower-wage contracts outside the civil service system. Previous evidence showed that such NGO-led contract teacher programs in public schools improved student learning outcomes in Kenya. This evaluation tested whether the same model could be scaled effectively by the government, which faced different political and bureaucratic constraints.", "details_inter": "Researchers collaborated with Kenya’s Ministry of Education and the NGO World Vision Kenya to conduct a randomized evaluation to test whether Kenya’s NGO-led contract teacher program could be scaled up effectively by the government. The evaluation took place between June 2010 to October 2011 in 192 public-primary schools (roughly 15,000 students) across fourteen districts and all eight Kenyan provinces. These schools had high student-teacher ratios. They were also larger and had lower test scores than the national average. Contract teachers, who were required to hold a teaching certificate, were placed in either second or third grade in the first year, and all were moved to third grade in the second year. Schools were instructed to split classes to reduce pupil-teacher ratios. Students receiving a contract teacher were typically between seven and eleven years old. The intervention involved multiple levels of randomization. Each school in the program received a contract teacher hired either by the government (64 schools) or the NGO (64 schools) or else was assigned to a comparison group and received no contract teacher (64 schools). The schools with contract teachers hired by the government or the NGO were further randomized to better understand the impacts of: High versus low teacher salaries: Teachers in 96 schools were offered KES 5,000 ($67) per month. Those in the remaining 32 were offered KES 9,000 ($121), which was equivalent to 50 percent of the average entry level civil servant teacher salary. Local versus central responsibility for recruiting and paying teachers: Contract teachers in 64 schools across government and NGO implementation were recruited and paid by local school management committees (SMCs), while teachers in the remaining 64 schools were recruited and paid either by the central education authorities, similarly to civil service teachers (for government-implemented schools) or by the NGO headquarter office in Nairobi. Local accountability: 64 schools received a training intervention focused on ensuring SMCs understood the role of contract teachers in their schools, while the remaining 64 schools received no such sensitization. The table below depicts how many schools received each type of intervention.", "results_lessons": "On average, hiring contract teachers improved student learning outcomes in English and math across all NGO-implemented schools, but it had no impact on test scores when implemented by the government, suggesting the design of the program, political considerations, and bureaucratic constraints were important considerations behind the program’s impact. The most effective intervention combinations varied between NGO- and government-implemented schools. In the NGO arm, the most effective design involved high salaries and training for SMCs. This combination led to test score gains of 0.81 standard deviations. By contrast in the government arm, the best-performing group involved high salary, SMC training, and centralized hiring, yielding gains of 0.53 standard deviations. NGOs were able to rely on local oversight and community involvement to manage the program effectively. In contrast, the government needed more centralized control to ensure consistency and follow-through, given its larger and more complex administrative structure. Political pushback may have affected the government’s ability to implement the most effective design. The government’s national scale-up of the contract teacher program triggered opposition from the teachers’ union, which demanded permanent civil service status for all contract teachers. This undermined the credibility of short-term contracts and weakened teacher incentives. Teachers in the government arm were more likely to identify with the union and less likely to believe their contracts were performance-based, which also disrupted the link between effort and pay, contributing to the absence of learning gains in the government-implemented version. Bureaucratic constraints may also have driven differences in impact between government- and NGO-implemented programs. On average, contract teachers hired by NGO-managed schools were more likely to be present in class (72.7 percent attendance in the NGO arm compared to 62.8 percent in the government arm), received fewer salary delays (2 months in the NGO arm compared to 3 months in the government arm), and were better monitored (96.1 percent of schools in the NGO arm had a monitoring visit compared to 85 percent in the government arm). These factors likely contributed to improved student performance. In contrast, government-managed schools faced implementation challenges, including delayed payments and weaker oversight. These issues weakened the accountability mechanisms that were central to the program’s theory of change, making it harder to link contract status to teacher effort and ultimately reducing the impact on learning.", "citations": "Bold, Tessa, Mwangi Kimenyi, Germano Mwabu, Alice Ng'ang'a, and Justin Sandefur. 2018. \"Experimental Evidence on Scaling up Education Reforms in Kenya.\" Journal of Public Economics 168 (2018): 1-20.", "run_id": "2026-02-24 180833", "scraped_at": "2026-02-24T18:10:24", "hash": "3b0898e6188b48659d0b85639a266fa2117cde1d29a2d33f20fdc0aaba1209a5"}

High-quality teaching is especially important in tutoring, which is one of the most effective ways to improve student outcomes and close educational gaps. Tutoring plays a particularly important role in math, a subject that is difficult to teach yet strongly tied to college completion and future income. Human-computer collaborations could be a powerful way to make use of the strengths of both humans and technology to improve education. Generative AI, particularly language models, could support new educators with their teaching. However, standard language models have limitations, since they often lack context, give direct answers instead of encouraging critical thinking, and overall have not yet shown clear improvements in learning outcomes.

The researchers introduced Tutor CoPilot, an AI program designed to improve education outcomes by providing tutors with real-time expert-like guidance during live sessions. Tutor CoPilot was integrated into a virtual tutoring platform with features like a problem display, shared whiteboard, and chat window. When the tutor activated it, Tutor CoPilot analyzed the ongoing content and interaction in the chat and offered tailored suggestions for responses to the tutors. Tutors were able to customize the guidance by editing or regenerating suggestions, or choosing from different strategies such as providing the solution, offering an example, providing a minor correction, giving a similar problem, simplifying the question, or encouraging the student. The evaluation took place over two months from March to May 2024. The researchers randomly assigned 783 full-time tutors into two groups: 1. Tutor CoPilot group (388 tutors): Tutors were given access to Tutor CoPilot. 2. Comparison group (395 tutors): Tutors were not given access to Tutor CoPilot. On average the tutors had about 21.5 months tutoring experience. To rate the quality of tutors, the provider observed a random selection of the tutor’s sessions and averaged the scores from an observation form. The tutors in the Tutor Co-Pilot Group received training on how to use Tutor CoPilot prior to their first tutoring sessions. Session outcomes were evaluated based on student’s mastery of the lesson content required for progressing to the next lesson and measured in “exit tickets.” The researchers also collected session chat, whiteboard activity, and overall Tutor Co-Pilot usage. In addition, qualitative interviews were conducted with tutors after the sessions. The following steps were taken to protect the users’ privacy and information in the implementation of the Tutor CoPilot system: The names of the students and tutors were de-identified before any data was shared through external application interfaces, and the conversation used as context was limited to the most recent 10 messages in order to limit the amount of user information shared.", "results_lessons": "Researchers found that Tutor CoPilot improved student learning outcomes as measured by student mastery of a lesson topic, measured in “exit tickets,” was especially beneficial to students of lower-rated and less-experienced tutors, and enhanced the quality of tutor engagement. Student learning: Students whose tutor had access to Tutor CoPilot had improved learning gains right after the tutoring session. They were four percentage points more likely to pass their exit tickets (66 percent of students in the Tutor CoPilot group compared to 62 percent in the comparison group). The study was not set up to assess Tutor CoPilot’s direct effects on statewide end-of-year math test scores. Impact on tutor effectiveness: Students of lower rated tutors were nine percentage points more likely to pass their exit tickets (65 percent in the Tutor CoPilot group compared to 56 percent in the comparison group). Students of less-experienced tutors were seven percentage points more likely to pass their exit tickets (68 percent in the Tutor CoPilot group compared to 61 percent in the comparison group). The tool helped less-effective tutors achieve outcomes similar to their higher-performing peers in the comparison group. Tutoring quality: Tutors with access to Tutor CoPilot were more likely than tutors without access to Tutor CoPilot to apply strategies that promoted student understanding, engagement, and skill development, e.g., asking students to further explain or asking questions to guide student thinking. In contrast, tutors without the tool tended to provide more direct or passive support, e.g., giving solution strategies or generic encouragement, compared to tutors with access to the tool. Perception of Tutor CoPilot by tutors: In post-lesson interviews, tutors generally found Tutor CoPilot helpful, especially for its clear explanations and ability to break down complex concepts in real time. However, some also noted areas for improvement, such as aligning suggestions more closely with students’ grade levels. Some responses were described as too advanced, requiring tutors to adapt and simplify the guidance. Cost-analysis: The total application programming interface cost for integrating the Tutor CoPilot program for 388 tutors over the 2-month study was US$1,419.66, resulting in an estimated annual cost of about US$20 per tutor. This does not include other costs for the tutoring program like salaries. Use of Results: The tutoring provider FEV Tutor incorporated Tutor CoPilot into all of its tutoring sessions following this study. Although FEV Tutor is no longer active as a company as of January 2025, other companies that offer tutoring services, such as Eedi, have adapted the concept of Tutor CoPilot and implemented it to support human tutors in chat-based tutoring systems. Taken together, the research on Tutor CoPilot demonstrated that AI-generated guidance, based on expert thinking, can improve tutor quality at a low cost with the potential to scale. As policymakers and researchers continue to explore the future of human-AI collaboration in real-world contexts like education, areas for further research include how well tutors retain the skills gained through real-time AI guidance; expanding Tutor CoPilot to new subjects, age groups, and skill areas; or examining how tutors personalize AI suggestions.", "citations": "Wang, Rose E., Ana T.

PayDash access reduced wage payment delays and increased household participation in MGNREGS. Its impact primarily came from making real-time payment processing information more accessible to bureaucrats.", "policy_issue": "Roughly one in four people worldwide receive government payments1. Yet, these payments are often delayed in the very places where they are most urgently needed, low-income countries where a large share of the people experiencing poverty live2. Such delays can have severe consequences, forcing households to choose between going hungry or taking on costly debt, deepening their poverty. Digital payment systems are often hailed as a solution to payment delays, but they do not always resolve the issue, especially when manual approvals are still required3. Nonetheless, there is untapped potential in the data generated by digital payment systems. When used effectively, this data can enhance information flows within government agencies, enabling stronger oversight and more timely payments. However, whether these improvements materialize depends on the underlying cause of the delays. Are bureaucrats simply overburdened and lacking timely access to information? Or are they using the system to extract personal benefits, rather than to improve program performance?", "context_of_eval": "MGNREGS is one of India’s largest social protection programs, guaranteeing low-income, rural households up to 100 days of paid manual work each year. In 2024-25, over 70 million households participated in the program. 37 percent of workers belonged to scheduled castes and tribes, communities that have historically faced significant social and economic disadvantages, compared to 30 percent of the overall rural population. Women also played a key role, completing 55 percent of the total workdays, even as overall female labor force participation in India had declined to just 20 percent. MGNREGS is implemented by tens of thousands of officials, across three levels of bureaucratic hierarchy: Frontline officials who verify the work and request wage payments; Sub-district level officials who manage frontline officials and release wage payments; District-level officials who have an overarching administrative role over sub-districts. Persistent delays in wage payments undermine MGNREGS’ promise of providing timely income support4 5. The program mandates that initial wage processing be completed within 8 days of work. But prior to the study, the average processing time in the study’s states was 18 days. These delays matter: each extra day in initial wage processing was linked to nearly a full day’s delay in workers getting paid. Weak infrastructure further complicates implementation. Subdistrict officials in the study identified poor internet connectivity and frequent power outages as one of their top operational challenges. These issues slow down access to program data and make monitoring more difficult. They also reported that tracking performance required navigating hundreds of web pages, and that reformatting the data for decision-making added significantly to their workloads.", "details_inter": "India’s Ministry of Rural Development and researchers conducted a randomized evaluation of PayDash, a web-and mobile-based platform designed to improve how wage payments are tracked under MGNREGS. PayDash uses automatic timestamps from the government’s information system to record when key steps like work verification and payment processing are completed. The platform allowed bureaucrats to view data on the number and length of payment delays, as well as the contact information of the specific official responsible for the delays. While this information is accessible through the existing MGNREGS website, PayDash makes it much easier for bureaucrats to access real-time information about program implementation. Additionally, the PayDash mobile app is also built to work in areas with poor internet or mobile connectivity, allowing users to access the latest available data from their last online session. The evaluation included over 1,200 bureaucrats and took place in 73 districts and 560 sub-districts in two states, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand. Each district was randomly assigned to be in one of four groups: Sub-district only (16 districts): Districts where only sub-district level officials received PayDash District only (17 districts): Districts where only district-level officials received PayDash Both sub-district and district (20 districts): Districts where both sub-district and district-level officials received PayDash Comparison (20 districts): Districts where no officials received PayDash PayDash was launched in Madhya Pradesh in February and March 2017, and in Jharkhand in October 2017. The evaluation ended in August 2018. As part of the rollout, researchers organized half-day sessions to conduct baseline surveys and train officials. All officials, regardless of whether they were assigned to use PayDash, received a refresher training on how to access MGNREGS data through the existing government website. Officials who were assigned to use PayDash received an additional hour of training, during which they installed the mobile app and learned how to use its features. Researchers drew on a range of data sources to measure the impact of PayDash. Usage was tracked using Google Analytics. Administrative data from over 17 million MGNREGS attendance registers were analyzed to assess wage payment processing times. Community demand for work and corruption was examined through government-led social audits. Additionally, data on the postings of district and sub-district officials were collected through phone-based tracking.", "results_lessons": "Overall, PayDash reduced wage payment delays, increased the number of active worksites, and increased household participation in MGNREGS. Its impact primarily came from making real-time payment processing information more accessible to bureaucrats. PayDash usage: When only district officials had access to PayDash, they used the platform an average of 5.4 times per month. This was slightly higher than the 4.3 sessions per month observed when only sub-district officials had access. When both district and sub-district officials had access, usage by sub-district officials remained similar, regardless of whether district officials also had access. Payment processing speed: In sub-districts with PayDash, officials processed wage payments 17 percent (1.4 days) faster than those in the comparison group. Faster processing also helped make payment timelines more consistent, reducing variation by 13 percent (0.6 days), relative to variation in the comparison group. MGNREGS participation: In sub-districts where PayDash was provided, households worked 10 percent more days per month relative to the comparison group, adding up to 1,700 additional days of work per sub-district each month. This was driven by the fact that PayDash increased active worksites by 23 percent, especially during the agricultural lean season when job options were limited. Mechanism of impacts: PayDash had similar effects whether provided to sub-district or district level officials. These results help distinguish between two ways PayDash could be used: to reduce wage payment delays or to extract rents. If officials struggled to obtain timely information, then providing PayDash to either sub-district or district level officials would lead to similar improvements. But if sub-district officials were misusing information by colluding with frontline officials to extract rents, then limiting PayDash access to district level officials would be more effective. The similar effects across both levels suggest that the main barrier to implementation was limited access to information, not rent-seeking behavior. Moreover, social audit data that tracked financial misappropriation showed no increase in corruption from PayDash access. Bureaucratic transfers: District officials can manage sub-district officer performance by transferring them between posts. These transfers typically serve as a form of punishment for poor program outcomes, can be costly for sub-district officers, and are disruptive to program delivery. In districts where district officials had access to PayDash, transfers of sub-district officials dropped by 11 percentage points (a 24 percent reduction). This suggests that PayDash may have helped district officials gain stronger knowledge on sub-district officer actions and thereby condition transfers on their effort rather than program outcomes. When compared to hiring additional staff, the main alternative for speeding up wage payments, PayDash delivered similar benefits at just 1 percent of the cost in its first year. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that for every $1 invested in PayDash, households saved over $7 in interest payments and gained 63 additional days of paid work, resulting in more than $165 in extra wages per household. Drawing on the results from the study and with support from J-PAL’s Innovation in Government Initiative, PayDash is now being integrated into central government systems to enable nationwide scale-up.

However, uptake was low in low-income countries, where fewer than 30 percent of households had a television, fewer than 50 percent owned a radio, and fewer than 20 percent had internet access as of 2020. 3 Against this backdrop, mobile phones emerged as a more accessible option for reaching students.

Phone call tutorials: In addition to the weekly texts, students received one-on-one 20-minute phone tutorials each week. Drawing on the Teaching at the Right Level pedagogy, instructors tailored lessons to each student’s learning level based on weekly assessments, focusing on foundational math skills like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Comparison group: Students in this group did not receive either intervention. The evaluations included the three groups in all countries except India, which did not have an SMS-only group.

Randomization also differed with settings: in India, Nepal, and Uganda, all groups were randomized at the household level; in the Philippines, NGO-led implementation was randomized at the household level, while government-led implementation was randomized at the school-grade level; and in Kenya, the phone call tutorial group was randomized at the school-grade level, while the SMS-only group was cross-randomized at the household level. To measure impacts, researchers conducted phone surveys at the program’s start and a few months after completion. Surveys included short learning assessments for students, covering two-digit addition and subtraction, multiplication, and division, which were measured on a scale of 0–4. To assess non-cognitive skills, students who had completed a riddle were asked whether they wanted to attempt a second riddle, a measure of perseverance, and whether they preferred a more challenging riddle, a measure of ambition. Caregivers were asked how often they did educational activities with their child in the previous three weeks. In Nepal, a supplementary survey asked government teachers if they tailored feedback to students based on their individual learning levels. During the evaluation, a typhoon named Typhoon Rai hit the Philippines, which destroyed 4,000 classrooms and further disrupted learning and schooling for 2 million children. Researchers tracked which students were affected and found that the original random assignment still held, allowing them to assess if the program was effective in this additional emergency.", "results_lessons": "Mobile phone instruction supported learning during school closures, especially when tutoring calls and SMS messages were offered together. SMS messages alone were only effective where access to learning was particularly low. The results reported below reflect the average effect across all countries in the study unless otherwise specified. Program engagement: Over 95 percent of households in the phone tutoring group answered at least one call. Week after week, engagement stayed consistent, with 70–80 percent of households taking part in the tutoring sessions. Impact on student learning: The combination of phone tutoring and SMS messaging increased student learning in addition, subtraction, multiplication and division by an average of 0.33 standard deviations (SD), with more pronounced improvements in the Philippines (0.45 SD) and Uganda (0.89 SD). In both countries, schools were closed for nearly two years, and students in the comparison group had very limited access to education. Students who received SMS messages alone saw a more modest impact of 0.08 SD on average. Gains were driven solely by impacts in Uganda (0.21 SD) and the Philippines (0.09 SD), suggesting that SMS-based learning is more likely to make a difference in settings where education is more constrained. The program helped all children make progress regardless of their initial skill level. NGO vs government delivery: In Nepal and the Philippines, learning gains were similar whether the program was implemented by government teachers or NGO tutors, indicating that governments can deliver the program just as effectively as NGOs. Impacts on non-cognitive skills: Students who received phone tutoring were 2.9 percentage points more likely to try another riddle (from a comparison group rate of 83.3 percent) and 6.2 percentage points more likely to choose a harder one (from a comparison group rate of 21.1 percent), suggesting improvements in perseverance and ambition. SMS messages alone had no impact on these outcomes. Impact on teacher and caregiver behavior: In the phone tutoring group in Nepal, teachers were 9.3 percentage points more likely to tailor their lessons to the student's learning levels (from a 77 percent likelihood in the comparison group). Across both SMS and phone tutoring groups, and all countries, parents were 4 percentage points more likely to do education activities with their children (from an 87 percent likelihood in the comparison group). Impact during the Typhoon Rai: For students impacted by Typhoon Rai in the Philippines, phone tutoring increased student learning by an average of 0.26 SD relative to the comparison group, indicating that phone tutoring can remain effective across different education crises. However, SMS messages alone did not prevent learning losses. Cost-effectiveness: The combined phone tutoring and SMS program is estimated to cost 11 USD per child. This intervention is associated with 3.9 Learning Adjusted Years of Schooling 5 per 100 USD spent, positioning it among the top 10 of 150 educational interventions analyzed in low- and middle-income countries. 6 Taken together, these results suggest that targeted phone call tutorials are an effective and scalable method to deliver education during emergencies, across different contexts and via government systems. Researchers attribute the program’s success to the high levels of engagement relative to interventions that leverage other remote learning platforms like radio or TV and the tailored pedagogical approach. In partnership with governments, Youth Impact is currently scaling the phone tutoring intervention in Botswana, India and the Philippines. In India, the Government of Karnataka has committed to expanding the phone tutoring program to reach over 1 million students through government school teachers. 7 In the Philippines, the program has scaled to 20 school division offices, with the potential to reach 20,000 students. 8", "citations": "", "run_id": "2026-02-24 180833", "scraped_at": "2026-02-24T18:10:24", "hash": "1cded9ef9ee21a3899f73c8e133690fde427cb3dfb1ff7ab866e7f84318aacb8"}

However, governments in fragile states often lack the capacity to collect enough taxes and to efficiently manage public spending. Where their capacity is limited, governments sometimes delegate tax collection to local elites instead of using state officials. Today, many sub-Saharan African countries engage local elites in tax collection. Delegating tax collection to local elites comes with advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, local elites usually have better information on local people, and costs are lower for governments because fewer tax offices are required. On the other hand, it is harder for the government to control local elites, which could come with increased potential for misalignment and corruption. Should governments in fragile states delegate their tax collection responsibilities to local elites to raise more revenue?", "context_of_eval": "The evaluation took place in the city of Kananga in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). With a population of almost 2 million inhabitants, in 2016 the average household in Kananga had a monthly income of US$106. Prior to the evaluation, the provincial government had tax revenues equal to about US$0.30 per person per year and provided few, low-quality public infrastructures and services. To increase tax revenues, the government held citywide property tax collection campaigns in 2016 and 2018. The government, in collaboration with researchers, used the 2018 property tax campaign to evaluate whether tax collection was higher when done by local elites with local knowledge compared to state actors belong to the central tax ministry. Local elites are city chiefs that are key members of their community, they mediate disputes and support the upkeep of local infrastructure. Chiefs are not paid a regular salary and typically maintain other roles (e.g., teacher, pastor). They often serve as chiefs for life.", "details_inter": "In collaboration with the provincial government of Kasaï-Central, researchers conducted a randomized evaluation to study if a local government with limited capacity could strengthen its tax systems by delegating tax collection to local elites in an urban setting. After the first property tax campaign in 20161, the provincial government of Kasai-Central hypothesized that involving local city chiefs in tax collection might grow revenues further. To test this idea, the researchers assisted in randomizing the type of tax collector assigned to collector in each neighborhood in the 2018 property tax campaign. The campaign had two steps: property registration and tax visits. During the property registration stage, collectors allocated a unique tax ID and judged each property’s tax liability. If households could not pay the respective tax at that time, the collectors scheduled follow-up appointments. The collectors were instructed to return to the household until they paid taxes. They had one month to finish the work in each neighborhood and were allocated one to two neighborhoods per month. Collectors worked in groups of two. The researchers randomly assigned 356 neighborhoods in the city of Kananga, including 45,162 properties, to five different groups differing in the identity of the tax collector and their access to local knowledge: 1. Central (110 neighborhoods, 14,489 properties): Fifty state collectors were responsible for tax collection. 2. Local (111 neighborhoods, 14,383 properties): One hundred eleven local city chiefs were responsible for tax collection. 3. Central + Local Information, CLI (80 neighborhoods, 9,422 properties): Same as Central, but chiefs also shared property owner information with state collectors after the property registration. 4. Central X Local, CXL (50 neighborhoods, 6,071 properties): In this group, one state collector and one chief worked together. Everything else remained the same. 5. Pure Comparison (5 neighborhoods, 797 properties): A few neighborhoods kept the system from before 2016, in which state collectors registered the property, assigned an ID, and distributed tax letters, which instructed the owner to pay taxes at the ministry, without further follow-ups. The focus of the study was on comparing the Central and Local groups. Administrative data (property registration data and payment records) as well as three household surveys were used to study the effect of the type of tax collector on tax compliance. The property tax campaign took place from May to December 2018, and the household surveys were carried out in three rounds from July 2017 to September 2019.", "results_lessons": "Researchers found that households were more tax compliant in neighborhoods where local chiefs collected taxes compared to those where state collectors collected, due to local information that chiefs possessed on households. Tax compliance and revenues: In neighborhoods where local chiefs collected taxes (“the Local” group), tax compliance was 9.5 percent, compared to 6.3 percent in neighborhoods where state collectors were responsible for the property tax campaign (the “Central” group), a 50.8 percent increase. This increased compliance translated into 44 percent higher property tax revenue. One concern with delegating tax collection to local elites is that it could encourage corruption and weaken trust in government. Despite concerns about mismanagement, chiefs were more likely to properly exempt vulnerable households (e.g., elderly people or people with disabilities) and were less likely to incorrectly assign a property value classification than state collectors, suggesting respect for the tax campaign’s rules and processes. However, chiefs were slightly more likely than state collectors to be paid bribes. In spite of this, researchers found no differences between chief and state tax collection neighborhoods in terms of views of government, trust in tax authorities, perceived fairness of property taxation, tax morale, or perceptions of tax enforcement, suggesting that delegating tax collection to local chiefs did not negatively impact peoples’ perceptions of government over the short term. Local information: Chiefs’ local information helped identify households more likely to pay property taxes. In addition to neighborhoods where local chiefs collected taxes, neighborhoods where city chiefs shared property owner information with state collectors (the “Central + Local Information” group) also saw improved tax collection compared to areas where state collectors were responsible for tax collection without such information. Without knowledge of local residents, state collectors had to rely on visible signs, like house quality, when deciding which households to visit when collecting taxes. Chiefs, using their local knowledge of non-visible characteristics like cash availability or attitudes toward taxes, targeted owners of lower-quality homes who were more willing and able to pay. Cost-effectiveness: Letting local chiefs collect taxes was more cost-effective than state collection. In areas where local chiefs handled tax collection, each US$1 spent on administration brought in 53 percent more return than in areas with state collectors, thanks to higher revenues and lower costs. Overall, in fragile and low-capacity settings, governments may gain in the short term by working together with local elites to collect taxes in cities.", "citations": "Balán, Pablo, Augustin Bergeron, Gabriel Tourek, and Jonathan L.

The conventional debt-based model of microcredit, characterized by rigid repayment plans and high-interest rates, often fails to stimulate the growth of high-potential but risky microenterprises. Flexible microfinance contracts—relying on performance-based loan repayment rules—offer a viable alternative for microentrepreneurs. Such contracts link repayments to business earnings; in this way, they represent a more collaborative relationship between lenders and entrepreneurs than the relationship offered by traditional debt-based financing. This more flexible form of financing could encourage riskier yet potentially more successful investments. Do performance-based repayment models improve on the traditional approach to microfinance, and generate better business outcomes and welfare gains than traditional microcredit?", "context_of_eval": "In Kenya, microentrepreneurs often lack access to formal employment opportunities. In a 2014-2015 qualitative survey, micro-distributors, or small-scale entrepreneurs who deliver consumer goods like food and beverages to local shops, also cited the lack of transportation as a key constraint to business productivity. Owning a bicycle allowed micro-distributors to expand their sales networks, reaching customers farther from their stockpoints. In particular, distributors with bicycles generated a much larger share of profits from shops located farther away, showing that bicycles enabled geographical expansion. Program participants were micro-distributors who sold chewing gum products and other goods. The average age was 31, 85 percent were male, and seventy percent were married. On average, they earned about Ks 13,300 per month (roughly US$130 in 2018). The program was implemented in partnership with FoodCo, a major global food manufacturer. FoodCo largely recruited and trained the micro-distributors and supplied the products they sold. This collaboration reflects a trend of private sector companies helping expand last-mile distribution networks in underserved markets.", "details_inter": "Between 2017 and 2020 in partnership with FoodCo, researchers conducted a randomized evaluation to understand how different financing options affected the business growth of micro-distributors in Kenya. The 161 micro-distributors were randomly assigned to one of four financing contracts or a comparison group. Each contract, if accepted, required an initial ten percent deposit, with the remaining ninety percent financed by a local lender. The contracts varied in repayment structure: Fixed monthly payment: Participants repaid the cost of the bicycle in equal installments over twelve months, with an added fifteen percent fee. Profit-based payments: Participants paid half the fixed monthly amount and added ten percent of their monthly earnings. This structure offered flexibility by lowering payments during slow months, but total payments could be higher if earnings were strong. Hybrid plan: Like the profit-based plan, the hybrid plan also combined fixed and earnings-based payments, but with a cap: once the total paid matched the cost of the fixed contract, no further payments were required. This cap limited the total cost and protected against high long-term payments. Community-based plan: Payments changed based on the average earnings of other distributors in the same region. This structure helped reduce the burden on micro-distributors if business was slow for everyone but did not discourage individual effort. Comparison group: Participants were not offered bicycle financing under any contract. They continued with their normal participation in the FoodCo micro-distribution program. All payments were made through Kenya’s widespread mobile money system, M-Pesa. Researchers measured outcomes including changes in business earnings, restocking frequency, sales expansion, business management improvements, loan repayment rates, and broader household impacts.", "results_lessons": "Micro-distributors who received flexible financing, especially the hybrid loan that adjusted payments based on earnings, saw higher profits. They also restocked more often, expanded their sales areas, managed their businesses better, and repaid their loans more. Financing uptake and debt: About 58 percent of micro-distributors accepted a financing contract, thus completing the required deposit and documentation to receive a bicycle. Take-up rates varied by contract type: around 69 percent of those offered hybrid and fixed contracts opted in, while approximately 47–49 percent accepted profit-based and community-based contracts. Business performance: Micro-distributors who financed bicycles nearly doubled their monthly profits over three years,, primarily by selling more products and reaching more customers. Those who adopted earnings-linked contracts, saw the highest gains, consistently outperforming those with fixed-payment debt contracts. The hybrid plan led to an increase of KES 1,528.51 from a base of KES 897.45 (a 170.3 percent increase, or about US$14.70 from a base of US$8.63), while the profit-based plan increased profits by KES 781.65 (an 87.1 percent increase, or about US$7.52). GPS tracking showed that financed micro-distributors traveled further and restocked more frequently, supporting sustained increases in sales. Researchers suggest that flexible repayment structures allowed participants to prioritize business growth without the constraints of fixed payments, contributing to steady, higher earnings. Contract repayment: Micro-distributors with hybrid and profit-based repayment plans repaid more of their loans over time. By the sixth month, those in the hybrid and profit-based plans were making higher payments than those in with fixed payments, reflecting stronger business growth. By month fifteen, repayment rates under these plans were higher (78–81 percent) compared to those in the fixed and community-based plans (58–59 percent). Researchers suggest that the ability to adjust payments based on earnings helped micro-distributors stay on track, while rigid repayment schedules made it harder to keep up. Cost-effectiveness: A cost-benefit analysis found increased returns and operating income across all stakeholders, including distributors, FoodCo, stock sellers, and lenders. Across all financing contracts, the benefits of the program exceeded its costs, and the earnings-linked financing model was the most cost-effective during the study period. Taken together, these findings suggest that flexible repayment structures can help small business owners grow their enterprises while also bringing benefits to suppliers and lenders.

Researchers noted that participants may not have believed the information regarding infant mortality due to personal experience, or that political instability or Covid-19 may have minimized progress. These findings are informative for current policy debates, as subsidized access to modern contraception is a central focus of women’s empowerment programs globally.

Technical tool group: Factories in this group received only a digitized assessment, replacing the traditional paper-based test. While their standard hiring process remained unchanged, the new tablet-based evaluation provided a standardized measure of technical skills, ensuring consistency in hiring and promotion decisions.

They mainly trade small quantities of goods and transport their products via foot or bicycle. On the other hand, the majority of large-scale traders are men, in part because they have better access to transportation like trucks to move large quantities of goods across the border. Informal traders buy and sell goods in markets on both sides of the Kenya-Ugandan border, yet over 80 percent of informal traders always sell in the same market.

Saving Groups (SGs) present a potential solution. Composed of 10-25 people from a community, members of SGs save their own money and lend it out to each other to earn interest. SGs avoid many common pitfalls of other microloan systems. Members don’t have to travel to a bank or pay fees for an account. SGs can offer flexibility in repayment terms. SGs often have high repayment rates and low default rates in part because the members of the SG come from the same community and therefore hold each other socially accountable which banks cannot do. However, SGs face a crucial problem: they have limited funding at the beginning of each cycle. Since they are self-funded, SGs rely on their members’ savings to give out loans, and these savings add up throughout the year, culminating in an annual payout to each member. After the payout, the groups are left with much less communal capital, limiting the amount of loans available to members at the beginning of the next cycle.

About 37 percent of Ugandan adults belonged to an SG in 2020.2 These groups are an essential way for people to access loans. However, only about halfway through their annual cycle do most SGs in Uganda have enough funds to meet the needs of their members. The evaluation took place in Nkozi, a rural sub-county in central Uganda. Seventy percent of participants were women, 76 percent were married, and almost all worked in agriculture. Many women reported experiencing debt during their lifetime and about 70 percent had taken out a loan from their SG before the study.

Comparison group (1,022 members across 46 SGs): SGs did not receive any outside funds. Researchers surveyed members before and after the study to measure how additional funds affected the number of loans SGs gave out, how much money each member collected at the end of the year, and whether the members failed to pay or delayed repaying their loans. The researchers also collected data on education, access to healthcare, and work-related activities.

As a group, members did not reduce their total savings and were not more likely to default or make delayed payments. Loans: Members whose SG groups received outside money were 8 percentage points more likely to take out a loan relative to the comparison group where 68 percent took out a loan (an 11.76 percent increase). This indicates how additional funds were needed for SGs to supply loans to all members who requested them. Default and delays: SGs that received additional capital were no more likely to have a member default on their loans relative to the comparison group, in which 69 percent of SGs had a member default. Researchers suggest that the infusion of cash did not cause members to make riskier choices. Payouts: Members of SGs who received additional funds ended the year with a UGX 74,000 (US$20 in 2021) higher average payout. The group’s average total payout was higher than the total amount of outside money supplementing the SGs. This indicates the capital could continue to be reinvested and grow allowing SG members to take out more loans in future years. Cost-analysis: Assuming the external capital is reinvested into the SGs every year, after five years, researchers predict an economic rate-of-return of 61 percent, making the program more cost-effective over several years than many forms of direct cash transfer.

People experiencing poverty face difficulty affording basic necessities like food, housing, transportation, childcare, and health care. Many safety net programs address each of these issues in isolation and may fall short of addressing the compounding effects of multiple, simultaneous hardships. Moreover, administrative burdens can make these programs difficult to navigate. In response, intensive case management has emerged as a promising strategy to help individuals navigate and address interconnected barriers to securing stable economic footing. While previous evaluations have focused on the effectiveness of case management in specific domains—such as mental health services, homelessness prevention, or workforce development—there is less evidence on whether more comprehensive, person-centered models can produce meaningful, long-term improvements across multiple indicators of well-being. The Padua program seeks to fill this gap by offering intensive, customized case management that supports individuals in identifying goals and accessing services tailored to their unique needs. This study builds on existing literature by evaluating the effectiveness of a holistic intervention model that reflects the complexity of poverty, aiming to understand whether such an approach can lead to sustained improvements in housing and labor market outcomes.", "context_of_eval": "In Tarrant County, Texas, 62 percent of the working-age population is currently employed, 30 percent receive SNAP benefits, and the average monthly earnings are US$767. Researchers partnered with Catholic Charities Fort Worth (CCFW)—a large urban service provider based in Tarrant County serving more than 50,000 clients annually as of 2019—to evaluate the impact of their Padua program. CCFW aims to support clients, primarily low-income working-age adults, in achieving four primary milestones toward economic stability: achieving a living wage, reducing reliance on transfer programs, decreasing debt, and increasing personal savings. Most individuals who request assistance from CCFW are seeking emergency financial assistance, likely as a result of an unexpected economic shock (e.g., job loss, eviction). Padua targets working-age adults who face barriers to economic mobility, such as low education, excessive debt, difficulty finding childcare, or an unstable living situation. Because Padua aimed to improve labor market outcomes, eligibility for the program required individuals to be willing and able to work. Padua takes a comprehensive approach to supporting clients, focusing on five key elements: A thorough in-take assessment to understand each participant's unique goals and challenges The development of a customized strength-based service plan A two-person case management team with small caseloads Flexible financial assistance Full, personalized case management services including referrals to a broad network of external services and resources for employment, education, transportation, immigration, and housing", "details_inter": "Researchers conducted a randomized evaluation to test the impact of Padua on housing stability, labor market outcomes, participation in public programs, debt and savings, spending, and health. Researchers recruited study participants from a pool of clients who had previously contacted the agency’s central intake system for emergency financial assistance for rent or utilities, immigration services, or other available programs. To be eligible for the Padua evaluation, individuals had to be between 18 and 55 years of age, have a total family income not sufficient to meet their needs, reside in Tarrant County, Texas, and have at least one working-age adult in their family who was willing and able to work. From March 2015 to October 2016, 427 eligible individuals were randomized to receive the Padua programming (“treatment group”) or the standard CCFW services (“comparison group”) which they originally sought. Take-up among those offered Padua was 91 percent. At baseline, the treatment and comparison groups were balanced, with no significant differences in key demographic factors such as age, education level, or employment. The study population was diverse, with participants facing varying levels of need—whether related to housing instability, employment challenges, or financial stress. Researchers collected administrative data and fielded a series of in-person surveys at enrollment, 12 months after enrollment, and 24 months after enrollment. Data for the primary outcomes (labor market, housing, participation in public programs, debt and savings, spending, and health) was collected through the surveys. Administrative data on earnings and employment, government program participation, and credit usage, was supplemental to the primary survey analysis. The study leveraged cost data from CCFW to assess the program’s cost-effectiveness.", "results_lessons": "The Padua intervention did not demonstrate significant impacts on employment, housing, reliance on public programs, debt and savings, or spending for low-income individuals overall. Considering that individuals faced a range of barriers at the program outset and each had unique goals, average treatment effects may mask important variations in how different individuals responded to the program. Labor Market Overall, there was no statistically significant effect of Padua on labor market outcomes for the full participating sample, though the estimated treatment effects indicated improved labor market outcomes before multiple hypothesis testing. Additionally, exploratory analyses suggested that treatment group participants who were not employed at the start of the intervention were 67 percent more likely to be employed at a full-time job 24 months after the intervention began (a 19.3 percentage point increase relative to the comparison group mean of 28.9). Housing Overall, there was no statistically significant effect of Padua on housing outcomes for the full participating sample, though treatment effects suggest that Padua led to improved housing outcomes before multiple hypothesis testing. Additionally, exploratory analyses suggest that, among those who were unstably housed at the start of the intervention, Padua programming increased the fraction of individuals in a lease or ownership arrangement by 34 percentage points (a 64 percent increase relative to the comparison group mean of 53.5) 24 months after the intervention began. Those who were stably housed at baseline demonstrated no change in housing outcomes at this point, which aligns with the program's focus on addressing each individual's most urgent needs first. Participation in Public Programs A key goal of the Padua program is to help participants reduce their dependence on public assistance programs, such as SNAP, TANF, Medicaid, and WIC. Overall, there was no statistically significant effect of Padua on reducing reliance on public programs for the full participating sample. However, there were significant results for certain subgroups. Treatment group participants who were stably housed at baseline were 0.09 standard deviations less likely to be participating in government programs at the 24-month follow up, relative to those who were stably housed at baseline and not randomized to participate in Padua. Among those who were not employed but stably housed at baseline, Padua participants were 0.13 standard deviations less likely to be participating in government programs at the 24-month follow up relative to those not randomized to participate in Padua. Debt and Savings Overall, Padua had no statistically significant effect on debt or savings outcomes for the full participating sample or identified subgroups. Spending Overall, there was no statistically significant effect of Padua on spending outcomes for the full participating sample and identifiable subgroups. However, Padua seemed to help participants improve their budgeting habits. Participation in Padua increased the likelihood that participants were using a budget 24 months after enrollment by 14 percentage points (a 24 percent increase relative to the comparison group mean of 59 percent). The effects were even larger among specific subgroups—the likelihood of using a budget for those who were not employed at baseline increased by 23 percentage points (a 39 percent increase relative to comparison group mean of 60 percent) and by 34 percentage points for those who were unstably housed at baseline (a 54 percent increase relative to a comparison mean of 63 percent). Health Overall, there was no statistically significant effect of Padua on health, insurance coverage, ER visits, and doctor visits for the full participating sample. On self-reported measures, those who participated in Padua were 14.7 percentage points more likely to report improved or excellent health in the 24-month survey (a 53 percent increase relative to the comparison group mean of 28). Cost-effectiveness Researchers estimate the marginal value of public funds (MVPF) using estimates for the participant willingness to pay (after-tax earnings gains combined with the financial assistance received through the program) and the total cost of administering the program, to assess the cost-effectiveness of the Padua program. The MVPF of the Padua program, without incorporating projected future earnings, is estimated to be 0.18, meaning that for every US$1 of funds spent on the program, US$0.18 benefits the participants. When assuming that the effects of the program persist for another five years, the MVPF increases to about US$0.26. Exploratory subgroup analyses suggest that the program may be more cost-effective when targeted at specific populations. Estimates for MVPFs for those without employment, those with stable housing, and those without employment and with stable housing yield higher estimates, ranging from US$0.3 to US$0.5 when relying on experimental estimates and ranging from US$1 to US$5.8 when assuming gains persist into the future. – While certain subgroups (such as those unemployed or unstably housed at baseline) likely benefited from Padua in the areas that they most needed support, the absence of effects across the full sample suggests the intervention may have a greater impact if targeted toward certain subgroup populations. Moreover, Padua’s highly individualized, wrap-around approach makes it difficult to isolate which specific components of the intervention are driving the observed impacts. Notably, the strongest treatment effects were observed among individuals facing multiple, compounding barriers to self-sufficiency. Refining intake procedures to better identify and prioritize high-need clients could enhance program impact and cost-effectiveness. At the same time, the diversity in participants' needs and outcomes highlights a key challenge. Future research should consider collecting data on participants’ self-identified goals and track progress toward those goals over time. Doing so could offer a more personalized and meaningful measure of success, while also providing insights into how well the program meets the diverse needs of its participants.", "citations": "Evans, William N., Shawna Kolka, James X.

CBT may also help older adults overcome functional impairments and more easily complete daily tasks by equipping them with skills to address everyday problems, sustain relationships, and improve their emotional wellbeing. Despite its effectiveness, many low- and middle-income countries lack licensed therapists to administer CBT due to limited funding and training opportunities. In these contexts, in-person therapy delivered by non-professionals has been shown to lower symptoms of depression. While talk therapy delivered remotely by non-professionals has been found to be effective at treating depression among older adults in high-income countries, no such evidence is available for older adults in low-income countries.

To be eligible for this evaluation, adults had to be aged 55 or older, accessible by phone, and living alone. Approximately 83 percent of participants were women, and 77.1 percent were widowed. A majority of participants (75 percent) lived in rural communities. Researchers found that about a third of participants were moderately or severely depressed and over 20 percent were mildly depressed. Adults in the study had low incomes, with an average monthly spending of INR 1,699 (US$20 in 2021). Nearly a quarter of participants reported skipping or cutting meals in 2018.

They randomly assigned 1,120 adults aged 55 or older living alone in Tamil Nadu to one of four groups: Phone-based CBT group (377 older adults): Participants agreed to join weekly 30- to 45-minute phone calls with CBT-trained lay counselors over six consecutive weeks. They could also join an additional booster session two months after the weekly program ended. Non-professional counselors, trained over two weeks in a specialized curriculum, helped participants brainstorm solutions to daily challenges and identify and plan activities that would boost their mood. The CBT curriculum was developed by a psychologist at Sangath, a mental health nonprofit.6 Cash transfer group (184 older adults): Participants could receive a one-time unconditional cash transfer of INR 1,000 (US$12 in 2021), delivered in-person. On average, comparison group participants spent INR 1,747 (US$21 in 2021) before the study began, making the cash transfer equivalent to 57 percent of their monthly spending.7 Phone-based CBT and cash transfer group (183 older adults): Participants could join the same phone-based CBT program described above, and received the same cash transfer of (INR 1,000, US$12 in 2021) one week after the CBT sessions ended. Cash was delivered regardless of participants’ participation in the CBT sessions. Comparison group (376 older adults): Participants in the comparison group were not offered the phone-based CBT sessions or the cash transfer. Participants in each group began receiving phone-based CBT, a one-time cash transfer, both, or neither in three waves starting in January, March, or August 2021. Due to a rise in Covid-19 cases across India in spring 2021, cash could not be delivered in the second wave, and hence there is only a comparison group and CBT group in that wave. Researchers collected information on participants’ functional impairment, feelings of depression, and food security about three weeks and three months after the end of the CBT in their wave. Researchers measured participants’ ability to perform daily tasks by asking them to rate their difficulty performing twelve activities of daily living in the past month. Results were scored from 0 (no functional impairment) to 48 (extreme functional impairment) points. Researchers measured depression by asking participants fifteen yes or no questions on their current mental well-being. Results were scored from 0 (least depressed) to 15 (most depressed) points. Researchers measured food security by asking participants if they had to skip a meal or reduce meal size in the past week.", "results_lessons": "One-time cash transfers reduced functional impairment for older adults living alone in Tamil Nadu three weeks later, and led to a small decline in feelings of depression. Neither cash transfers, CBT, nor the combination of the two had an impact on outcomes at three months. Functional impairment: At three weeks, participants who received a cash transfer experienced a decreased effect on their functional impairment of 2.9 points relative to the comparison group. A lower score indicates that participants were better able to perform daily tasks. The CBT and combined groups did not impact people’s functional impairment, and the effect of cash had faded by three months. Among older women, cash transfers, phone-based CBT, and their combination reduced functional impairment in the short term. At three weeks, women who received cash, CBT, or both experienced decreased functional impairment effects of 4.1, 3.5, and -3.2 points, respectively, relative to the comparison group. Among older men, phone-based CBT, cash transfers, and their combination worsened functional impairment at three months. The researchers highlight the importance of further study to explore why CBT and cash transfers appeared to affect men negatively and in differing ways to women. Depression: People who received cash transfers experienced a small improvement in depression symptoms three weeks after the program, with a 1 point greater decrease on their depression score relative to the comparison group. The other two interventions showed no impact at three weeks, and none of the treatments led to improvements at the three-month follow-up. This contrasts with other studies which find that CBT reduced depression among older adults in India and in high-income countries.8 The effect of cash on depression at three weeks is driven by women, who enjoyed a 1.4 point greater decrease on their depression score. Since the average woman in the study was mildly depressed at the start, this reduction implies that on average women in the cash transfer group fell below the threshold for depression diagnosis. Food security: None of the interventions affected food security three weeks or three months after they ended. Overall, the interventions studied here had limited impacts on functional impairment, depression, and food security. Cash transfers appear to be more cost-effective than phone-based CBT as they generated short-run improvements in functional impairment and depression, and were less expensive (cash cost US$12 per person compared to US$19 for CBT). The impacts on depression align with other findings that cash transfers can improve mental health.

Little is known about land formalization in sub-Saharan African cities, where land is more valuable and reliance on social institutions is weaker than in rural settings. In Kananga, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), researchers conducted a randomized evaluation to test the impact of a subsidized land titling program on both starting and completing land registration, as well as on citizens’ participation in social institutions. Being offered a land titling subsidy substantially increased the number of citizens who began the property registration process and obtained a land title, while decreasing participation in social institutions and worsening citizens’ evaluations of chiefs.", "policy_issue": "Property rights are considered crucial for economic development and good governance. However, they remain rare, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where only about 10 percent of land is formally titled. Weak property rights may discourage citizens from investing because of fears of expropriation. Given their importance, organizations such as the World Bank have supported land registration campaigns in low- and middle-income countries. Yet despite these efforts, land formalization rates remain very low. Some argue that citizens may achieve tenure security informally through membership in social institutions and customary land rights, which can function as a substitute for formal titles. To understand the relationship between land titling and social institutions, there is a need to study the demand for formal titles in Africa more systematically.", "context_of_eval": "The DRC, often considered a fragile state, had the fourth largest population in Africa in 2023. The country also faces severe financial challenges, with weak fiscal capacity: its tax-to-GDP ratio ranked 188th out of 200 countries between 2000 and 2017. The evaluation took place in Kananga, the capital of Kasaï Central province. With a population of 1.6 million, Kananga is the 4th-largest city in the DRC. The average monthly income there is US$106. As in the rest of the country, Kananga’s fiscal capacity is weak and land formalization rates are low. In 2017, fewer than 16 percent of residents held formal land titles. Like other African cities, Kananga is urbanizing rapidly, driving up property prices: the average property value among participants in the intervention was US$5,700. Despite rising property values, most citizens refrain from obtaining a title because the process is burdensome and costly. Some citizens reported paying 10 times more than the official price of a title. The lack of formal land titles creates problems for both citizens and the government. Kananga’s residents remain at risk of dispossession—more than 25 percent of study participants reported a legal dispute over property. Citizens also had difficulty accessing formal finance because they lacked property titles for collateral. Like many African cities, Kananga’s property rights regime is fragmented, with an urban core surrounded by peripheral areas—known as chefferies—where state presence is weak and customary land rights are presided over by chiefs. As elsewhere in Africa, citizens of Kananga are embedded in a dense network of social institutions. They routinely participate in churches, mutual aid societies, and Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCAs), and contribute to community events such as weddings and funerals. Past research on rural Africa shows such institutions can provide informal insurance. Local elites, known as avenue chiefs, are also prominent, and prior work highlights their role in land governance. For this reason, some argue participation in these institutions may substitute for formal land rights. A crucial question is therefore how participation in these institutions shapes the demand for formal land titles in urban settings.", "details_inter": "In partnership with the Provincial Government of Kasaï Central, researchers conducted a randomized evaluation that offered citizens the opportunity to obtain land titles at a reduced price for a limited period. Randomization was conducted at the household level in 364 neighborhoods using satellite imagery. After changes in government eligibility requirements, 483 households qualified for the program and were randomly assigned to either the subsidy group or the comparison group. In the subsidy group, 254 households were offered a subsidy to cover land title costs. At the time of the study, the official price of a land title was US$100. Within the subsidy group, households could choose among three formal land titles at reduced prices: Certificat d’Enregistrement (CE): a formal land title conferring the highest legal recognition of property ownership. The average subsidized price was US$75—a 92.5 percent reduction from costs of up to US$1,000. Contrat de Location: a three-year contract between the citizen and the government, which can lead to a CE if citizens make annual payments over three years. The average subsidized price was US$40. Acte de Vente Notarié: a document providing proof of land acquisition. The average subsidized price was US$20. In the comparison group, 229 households still had the option of obtaining a land title through the regular procedure. Prior to the intervention, a baseline survey (July–December 2017) collected information on urban chiefs, public goods, property characteristics, demographics, governance, experiences with taxation and payments to the state, political beliefs, and participation in social institutions. After the program ended, the research team conducted two endline surveys with property owners (March 2019–February 2020). These surveys asked about views of and engagement with the government and city chiefs, participation in social institutions, and tenure security. Researchers also drew on administrative data from Kasaï Central’s cadastral and land titling offices. Ethical Considerations. In addition to approval from an institutional review board, researchers sought and obtained local ethical approval from the University of Notre-Dame du Kasaï, Kananga’s oldest university. In his letter of support, the University’s academic dean wrote that the project “will help to understand the importance of private property,” adding that it “does not hurt the local culture.” As compensation, participants received about US$2 per survey hour.", "results_lessons": "The program’s design allows for the study of both the demand for land titles and their effects. Specifically, the researchers addressed two main questions: (1) Does reducing barriers to formalization increase demand for formal land titles? (2) How does land titling interact with citizens’ participation in social institutions? Starting the property registration process and receipt of land titles. Citizens randomly offered a subsidized land title were 44 percentage points (5,000 percent) more likely to initiate the titling process—a costly outcome in itself—compared to 1 percent in the comparison group. They were also 13.7 percentage points (3,100 percent) more likely to obtain a title, compared to nearly 0 percent in the comparison group. Demand for titles was higher among richer, more educated households, and those with higher-value properties. The gap between demand and actual receipt of a title likely reflects a combination of poor coordination across government offices, weak bureaucratic incentives, and the program’s logistical challenges. Overall, reducing the price and the barriers citizens face to obtaining a formal title reveals substantial latent demand for formalization, indicating the time and money required to secure a title discouraged citizens from pursuing formalization. However, this significant increase in program take-up masks results that varied depending on citizens’ participation in social institutions and their relationships with urban chiefs. Participation in social institutions. Citizens who were offered a land titling subsidy and who belonged to a mutual aid society, made contributions to churches, or contributed to weddings and funerals were more likely to start the land titling process relative to the comparison group. However, while participation in social institutions predicted demand for titles, it did not lead to a corresponding increase in the actual receipt of land titles. These results challenge the argument that participation in informal insurance institutions reduces demand for formal titling. Demand for formalization was, in fact, higher among citizens with higher baseline levels of participation in these institutions. Connections to chiefs. Citizens with closer connections to their local chiefs—for example, those who knew their chief’s name or whose chiefs were longtime residents of their community—were more likely to start the titling process. This suggests citizens saw chiefs as intermediaries who could help them get titles. However, other characteristics of chiefs affected citizens’ chances of obtaining a land title. Chiefs affiliated with a political party reduced citizens’ chances of getting a land title. While citizens may have believed chiefs could help them obtain land titles, chiefs’ incentives may conflict with citizens’ desire for titles. Social effects. The program affected citizens’ participation in and perceptions of the same institutions that shaped program take-up. First, being offered a land titling subsidy reduced citizens’ participation in ROSCAs by 7.5 percentage points (23.4 percent) relative to the comparison group average of 32 percent. The program also lowered church contributions by 9.1 percentage points (16.5 percent) relative to the comparison group average of 55 percent. Second, citizens offered the land titling program saw chiefs 16.8 percentage points (or 25 percent) less favorably relative to the comparison group’s average view of 67 percent. Together, these results indicate citizens exit social institutions when given the opportunity to formalize their land and cast doubt on the idea that formal titling and social institutions may be complements. Citizens of Kananga preferred land formalization to informal institutions, which they were willing to exit if they got titles. Formalization may offer citizens an exit option from informal institutions. Perhaps the most important lesson is that citizens have high demand for formal land property rights in Kananga, and yet are stymied in their efforts to obtain property titles by high prices, excessive red tape, and bureaucratic incentives. As urbanization proceeds at a sweeping pace in sub-Saharan Africa and land values continue to rise, cities face formalization bottlenecks. However, the significant increase in take-up induced by the program indicates that carefully designed reforms aimed at simplifying the land titling process and reducing bureaucratic discretion have the potential to significantly expand formalization. Reflecting this, in 2017, DRC’s government provided guidance about setting ceilings on prices for land titles and standardizing the process, in which the guidance resembled the intervention from this study. While based on a single-city intervention, these results can inform larger titling campaigns. Reforms that make the land titling process simpler and consider differences between urban and rural land formalization could be useful as sub-Saharan Africa continues to urbanize at a rapid pace.", "citations": "", "run_id": "2026-02-24 180833", "scraped_at": "2026-02-24T18:10:24", "hash": "5a49a79f23f8c4d566bfa157db00cb5e858f336b583a0edddf6e0099b82ceaa0"}

Results are forthcoming.", "policy_issue": "Deforestation is a critical issue across the globe, driving biodiversity loss and reducing the planet’s capacity to absorb carbon dioxide. Illegal logging and other exploitative forest activities contribute to the unsustainable use of natural resources1. The illicit trade in timber and forest products is fueled by a complex mix of factors, including weak forest governance and regulation enforcement in producer countries, insufficient verification standards in consumer countries, and sustained demand for forest products. Until recent decades, many natural woodlands in low-income countries such as Ethiopia were state-owned and effectively open-access, making them vulnerable to widespread exploitation and deforestation. In response, governments have explored using different forest management and governance systems, including community-based forest management (CBFM). These programs transfer management and extraction rights to local communities, aiming not only to conserve forests but also to create new sources of forest-based income. In turn, this income may enable smallholder farmers to invest more in their farms and boost productivity. Can community-based forestry interventions improve the livelihoods of participating smallholder farmers, while promoting forest conservation?", "context_of_eval": "Natural forests in Ethiopia were state-controlled and effectively open-access before the 1990s, leading to widespread illegal exploitation of resources. In Oromia regional state, home to seventy percent of Ethiopia’s woodlands, forests disappeared at a rate of three percent per year from 1950 to 1990. Since then, the Ethiopian government has sought to curb illegal forest extraction by devolving management authority to local communities through a CBFM program. Forest user groups (FUGs) were established and granted exclusive rights to extract and trade timber and non-timber resources in areas they managed. Today, more than 1,000 FUGs collectively manage nearly 2 million hectares of forest. Following this redistribution of power, deforestation rates fell, and local residents were able to earn forest-linked incomes. Previous research shows that families invest part of this forest-related income back into their farms, suggesting a potential pathway toward agricultural modernization. Given these positive results, the Oromia government is now interested in expanding CBFM to the entire region.", "details_inter": "In partnership with the Oromia Forest and Wildlife Enterprise (OFWE), the public agency in charge of managing forests in the Oromia regional state, researchers are testing the impact of CBFM on farming techniques, rural livelihoods, and forest conservation. As part of OFWE’s efforts to expand CBFM across the entire Oromia region in the coming years, researchers are assigning 243 villages in Oromia to one of four different groups: CBFM program with status quo leader selection (500 households): Villages in this group will transition to OFWE’s community-based forestry management system. Leaders of this new FUG will come from a pool of local volunteers, traditionally village elites supported by other village members. CBFM program with anonymized voting for leader selection (500 households): Villages in this group will transition to OFWE’s community-based forestry management system. Residents will select leaders of the new FUG anonymously. CBFM program with a leadership gender quota (500 households): Villages in this group will transition to OFWE’s CBFM system. OFWE will mandate that the vice-chair and at least one other member of the FUGs executive committee be women. Comparison group (1,000 households): Villages in this group will continue to use their traditional, business-as-usual forest management practices, serving as a comparison group. Researchers are conducting three rounds of data collection: baseline (before the intervention starts), midline (approximately eleven months into the intervention), and an endline (2026). At midline, researchers are collecting extensive data on leadership selection mechanisms and their impact on leader quality across multiple dimensions including honesty, level of corruption, social networks, and managerial capability. The endline analysis will examine how the main outcomes, forest-based income of group members and forest conservation, are affected by different leadership selection modalities. The analysis relies on survey data, market data, satellite imagery, experts’ assessments of forest quality, and focus group discussions to elucidate the mechanism linking intervention to impacts. The introduction of alternative leadership selection modalities should improve leadership quality and result in better economic outcomes for group members and more sustainable forest management (Kahsay and Bulte 2021, Kahsay et al. 2023).

Using the new survey data, researchers were able to estimate the extent of harassment at the firm more accurately.", "policy_issue": "Harassment at work is a concern in many industries and workplaces. Firms and employers struggle to tackle this problem in part because victims may choose not to report abuses due to fear of retaliation or damage to their reputation. Traditional surveys that directly ask people to report their experiences of harassment often capture fewer reports than what actually occur, given how sensitive the topic is. Increasing the security of organizations’ approaches to asking workers about their experiences with harassment is one potential strategy to get more accurate information on harassment in a workplace. However, there is limited direct evidence testing this approach or showing how it changes what policymakers learn from reporting data.", "context_of_eval": "It is estimated that high proportions of women in both low- and middle-income countries and high-income countries experience sexual harassment at workplaces. In Bangladesh’s garment industry, harassment is also a persistent issue. Earlier studies suggest that low wages, limited access to legal support, and traditional gender norms give managers considerable power to harass workers. Although people believe harassment to be widespread in this industry, workers rarely report it. Researchers partnered with an anonymous large garment manufacturer in Bangladesh that employed more than 25,000 workers to conduct a phone survey aimed at obtaining more reliable data on workplace harassment. The firm’s senior leaders sought to better understand workers’ experience in the workplace and improve their well-being. The senior leaders also wanted to use this data to inform the firm’s human resources policies. In apparel production, the firm often organizes workers according to line teams. Line teams are likely to be either predominantly women or men, depending on their function – for example, only men typically work in cutting sections, while mostly women work in sewing and finishing. By contrast, more than 90 percent of managers are men.", "details_inter": "Researchers collaborated with the firm’s human resources department to conduct a randomized evaluation on the impact of different survey methods on how workers answered questions about experiencing harassment during work. Using phone surveys, they randomly selected 2,245 workers into 9 groups that each received different combinations of the following techniques aimed at encouraging people to give accurate answers on sensitive topics: Hard garbling (HG): HG is a technique that provides people with plausible deniability in surveys by automatically marking some responses as complaints. The interviewer told workers assigned to this version of the survey that one in five answers asking about harassment would be automatically recorded as \"yes\". This gave people an option to deny reporting issues and made it safer for people to report without worrying about being blamed later. Rapport building (RB): In this version of the survey, the interviewer spent time chatting with the worker about life outside of work to create a sense of trust and emotional connection. The aim was to help workers feel at ease to answer sensitive questions. Low personally identifiable information (Low PII): In this version, interviewers did not ask workers about information that someone who saw the survey could use to identify the worker. In particular, interviewers did not ask workers the name of their direct supervisor or which production team they worked on. Comparison group: In this version, workers received a business-as-usual survey—interviewers asked questions about harassment directly, did not apply extra effort to build trust, and gathered personally identifying information. Interviewers asked workers about workers’ experience with three types of harassment in the past year—physical harassment, sexual harassment, and threatening behavior—by their direct supervisor. They also posed questions on worker well-being like mental health and job satisfaction. The researchers were also interested in how improved reporting data could be used to answer policy-relevant questions about the nature of harassment in the firm, such as: How prevalent is harassment? What share of employees are responsible for the damage? How isolated are victims within teams? All respondents were assured of a strong commitment to confidentiality as part of the process for consenting to participate in the study. To design the survey questions for the context, the research team conducted focus group discussions, interviews, and pilot surveys with garment workers before the main surveys.", "results_lessons": "Making it safer for workers to report if they experienced harassment by using the hard garbling (HG) method, which automatically records a subset of cases as harassment, gave workers an option to deny having reported. This increased the estimated rate of harassment reports from both women and men, and across different types of workplace harassment. Harassment reporting: In the comparison group using the business-as-usual survey method, 9.9 percent of workers reported experiencing threatening behavior, 1.53 percent reported physical harassment, and 1.78 percent reported being sexually harassed by their supervisor. When interviewers used the HG survey method, workers were 4.5 percentage points more likely to report threatening behavior, 4.4 percentage points more likely to report physical harassment, and 4.8 percentage points more likely to report sexual harassment. Both women and men reported more experiences of harassment, although the effect was larger among men. Researchers found that the other survey tactics of building rapport with workers or removing identifying information did not have clear effects on helping workers report more cases across all different types of harassment. Harassment statistics for informing policy decisions: To help the anonymous firm use data to answer policy-relevant questions, researchers used the results of the HG surveys to more accurately estimate the nature of harassment in these factories. They measured how common harassment was, how many managers were involved, and whether a single manager was more likely to harass one or several team members. Using the new survey data, researchers estimated that 13.5 percent of workers experienced threatening behavior, 5.7 percent physical harassment, and 7.7 percent sexual harassment by their managers. At the team level (there were seven workers per production team on average), harassment is widespread: 72 percent of teams had at least one worker experiencing threatening behavior, 40 percent had at least one who had suffered sexual harassment, and 25 percent had at least one who had been subject to physical harassment. However, victims were often the only person on their team to experience (or report) the harassment. Overall, the research showed that workers were more likely to report sensitive harassment experiences when the interview method allowed them to deny that they had reported harassment. The findings also showed that harassment in this context was widespread, that many managers were responsible, and that victims were often isolated. The researchers used the results to inform the senior management of the firm about the extent and nature of harassment in the firm, suggesting viable policy options to address the problem. Researchers suggested that for this firm, a policy of firing all offending managers would be very costly, and the firm may find it less costly to focus on changing the behavior of existing managers and changes in company norms.", "citations": "", "run_id": "2026-02-24 180833", "scraped_at": "2026-02-24T18:10:24", "hash": "b02d4811d662df152bf994b46a0cb169e8e15186ed50db8158d8baa52f121b6b"}
